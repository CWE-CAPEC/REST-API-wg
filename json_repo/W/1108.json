{"ID":"1108","Name":"Excessive Reliance on Global Variables","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The code is structured in a way that relies too much on using\n\t\t\t\t\tor setting global variables throughout various points in the code, instead of\n\t\t\t\t\tpreserving the associated information in a narrower, more local\n\t\t\t\t\tcontext.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1076","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Maintainability"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
