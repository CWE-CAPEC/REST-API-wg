This assumption may be false if the device has improperly secured power management features, or similar features. For mobile devices, minimizing power consumption is critical, but these devices run a wide variety of applications with different performance requirements. Software-controllable mechanisms to dynamically scale device voltage and frequency and monitor power consumption are common features in today's chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault injection and side-channel attacks without having physical access to the device.\n\n\nFault injection attacks involve strategic manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired effect such as skipping an authentication step, elevating privileges, or altering the output of a cryptographic operation. Manipulation of the device clock and voltage supply is a well-known technique to inject faults and is cheap to implement with physical device access. Poorly protected power management features allow these attacks to be performed from software. Other features, such as the ability to write repeatedly to DRAM at a rapid rate from unprivileged software, can result in bit flips in other memory locations (Rowhammer, [REF-1083]).\n\n\nSide channel analysis requires gathering measurement traces of physical quantities such as power consumption. Modern processors often include power metering capabilities in the hardware itself (e.g., Intel RAPL) which if not adequately protected enable attackers to gather measurements necessary for performing side-channel attacks from software.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"285","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Memory Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Power Management Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Clock/Counter Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"An architect may initiate introduction of this weakness via exacting requirements for software accessible power/clock management requirements"},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"An implementer may introduce this weakness by assuming there are no consequences to unbounded power and clock management for secure components from untrusted ones."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","Modify Application Data","Bypass Protection Mechanism"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Manual Analysis","Description":"Perform a security evaluation of system-level architecture and design with software-aided physical attacks in scope."},{"Method":"Automated Dynamic Analysis","Description":"\n\nUse custom software to change registers that control clock settings or power settings to try to bypass security locks, or repeatedly write DRAM to try to change adjacent locations.
