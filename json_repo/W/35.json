Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"MitigationID":"MIT-5.1","Phase":["Implementation"],"Strategy":"Input Validation","Description":"\n\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\n\nWhen validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, the \".../...//\" manipulation is useful for bypassing some path traversal protection schemes. If \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion (as some regular expression engines and other algorithms operate) the string can collapse into the unsafe \"../\" value (CWE-182). Removing the first \"../\" yields \"....//\" and the second removal yields \"../\". \n","Effectiveness":"High"},{"MitigationID":"MIT-20","Phase":["Implementation"],"Strategy":"Input Validation","Description":"Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180).
