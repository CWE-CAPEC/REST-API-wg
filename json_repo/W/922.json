The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were \"insecure by design\" [REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications."},{"BodyText":"At least one OT product stored a password in plaintext."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2009-2272","Description":"password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2272"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1283","Authors":["Forescout Vedere Labs"],"Title":"OT:ICEFALL: The legacy of \"insecure by design\" and its implications for certifications and risk management","PublicationYear":"2022","PublicationMonth":"06","PublicationDay":"20","URL":"https://www.forescout.com/resources/ot-icefall-report/"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed-with-Review","Rationale":"This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate","Comments":"Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit","Reasons":["Abstraction"]},"Notes":[{"Type":"Relationship","Note":"There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311).
