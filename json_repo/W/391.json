It currently combines information from three different taxonomies, but each taxonomy is talking about a slightly different issue. CWE analysts might map to this entry based on any of these issues. 7PK has \"Empty Catch Block\" which has an association with empty exception block (CWE-1069); in this case, the exception has performed the check, but does not handle. In PLOVER there is \"Unchecked Return Value\" which is CWE-252, but unlike \"Empty Catch Block\" there isn't even a check of the issue - and \"Unchecked Error Condition\" implies lack of a check. For CLASP, \"Uncaught Exception\" (CWE-248) is associated with incorrect error propagation - uncovered in CWE 3.2 and earlier, at least. There are other issues related to error handling and checks."},{"Type":"Other","Note":"\n\nWhen a programmer ignores an exception, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of two
