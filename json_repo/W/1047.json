{"ID":"1047","Name":"Modules with Circular Dependencies","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product contains modules in which one module has references that cycle back to itself, i.e., there are circular dependencies.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nAs an example, with Java, this weakness might indicate cycles between packages.\n\n\nThis issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product due to insufficient modularity, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThis issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1120","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Reliability"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCMM","EntryID":"ASCMM-MNT-7"},{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCRM","EntryID":"ASCRM-RLB-13"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-960","Section":"ASCMM-MNT-7","Authors":["Object Management Group (OMG)"],"Title":"Automated Source Code Maintainability Measure (ASCMM)","PublicationYear":"2016","PublicationMonth":"01","URL":"https://www.omg.org/spec/ASCMM/","URLDate":"2023-04-07"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-961","Section":"ASCRM-RLB-13","Authors":["Object Management Group (OMG)"],"Title":"Automated Source Code Reliability Measure (ASCRM)","PublicationYear":"2016","PublicationMonth":"01","URL":"http://www.omg.org/spec/ASCRM/1.0/"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.","Comments":"Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.","Reasons":["Other"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Content Team","SubmissionOrganization":"MITRE","SubmissionDate":"2018-07-02","SubmissionComment":"Entry derived from Common Quality Enumeration (CQE) Draft 0.9.","SubmissionVersion":"3.2","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2019-01-03"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-08-20","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-01-31","ModificationComment":"updated Description"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated References, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2024-02-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes","ModificationVersion":"4.14","ModificationReleaseDate":"2024-02-29"}]}
