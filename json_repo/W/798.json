In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n","LikelihoodOfExploit":"High","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1391","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"287","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"344","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"671","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"PeerOf","CweID":"257","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Mobile","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"ICS/OT","Prevalence":"Often"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Access Control"],"Impact":["Bypass Protection Mechanism"],"Note":"\n\nIf hard-coded passwords are used, it is almost certain that malicious users will gain access to the account in question.\n\n\nAny user of the product that hard-codes passwords may be able to extract the password.

Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.\n\n\nAttach the monitor to the process and perform a login.
