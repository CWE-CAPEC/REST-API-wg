{"ID":"690","Name":"Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference","Abstraction":"Compound","Structure":"Chain","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product does not check for an error after calling a function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference.","ExtendedDescription":"While unchecked return value weaknesses are not limited to returns of NULL pointers (see the examples in CWE-252), functions often return NULL to indicate an error status. When this error condition is not checked, a NULL pointer dereference can occur.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"StartsWith","CweID":"252","ViewID":"709"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"252","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Memory-Unsafe","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"A typical occurrence of this weakness occurs when an application includes user-controlled input to a malloc() call. The related code might be correct with respect to preventing buffer overflows, but if a large value is provided, the malloc() will fail due to insufficient memory. This problem also frequently occurs when a parsing routine expects that certain elements will always be present. If malformed input is provided, the parser might return NULL. For example, strtok() can return NULL."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"]},{"Scope":["Integrity","Confidentiality","Availability"],"Impact":["Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands","Read Memory","Modify Memory"],"Note":"In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or reading memory is possible, which may lead to code execution."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Black Box","Description":"This typically occurs in rarely-triggered error conditions, reducing the chances of detection during black box testing."},{"Method":"White Box","Description":"Code analysis can require knowledge of API behaviors for library functions that might return NULL, reducing the chances of detection when unknown libraries are used."},{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-15","Method":"Automated Dynamic Analysis","Description":"Use tools that are integrated during compilation to insert runtime error-checking mechanisms related to memory safety errors, such as AddressSanitizer (ASan) for C/C++ [REF-1518].","Effectiveness":"Moderate","EffectivenessNotes":"Crafted inputs are necessary to reach the code containing the error, such as generated by fuzzers.
