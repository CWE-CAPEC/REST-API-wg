{"ID":"583","Name":"finalize() Method Declared Public","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product violates secure coding principles for mobile code by declaring a finalize() method public.","ExtendedDescription":"A product should never call finalize explicitly, except to call super.finalize() inside an implementation of finalize(). In mobile code situations, the otherwise error prone practice of manual garbage collection can become a security threat if an attacker can maliciously invoke a finalize() method because it is declared with public access.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"668","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability"],"Impact":["Alter Execution Logic","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands","Modify Application Data"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.

Because mobile code developers have little if any control of the environment in which their code will execute, special security concerns become relevant. One of the biggest environmental threats results from the risk that the mobile code will run side-by-side with other, potentially malicious, mobile code. Because all of the popular web browsers execute code from multiple sources together in the same JVM, many of the security guidelines for mobile code are focused on preventing manipulation of your objects' state and behavior by adversaries who have access to the same virtual machine where your product is running."}]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)","EntryID":"MET12-J","EntryName":"Do not use finalizers"},{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP28","EntryName":"Unexpected access points"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
