{"ID":"598","Name":"Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Diagram":"/data/images/CWE-598-Diagram.png","Description":"The web application uses the HTTP GET method to process a request and includes sensitive information in the query string of that request.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"201","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Application Data"],"Note":"At a minimum, attackers can garner information from query strings that can be utilized in escalating their method of attack, such as information about the internal workings of the application or database column names. Successful exploitation of query string parameter vulnerabilities could lead to an attacker impersonating a legitimate user, obtaining proprietary data, or simply executing actions not intended by the application developers."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)","Effectiveness":"High"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"When sensitive information is sent, use the POST method (e.g. registration form)."}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2022-23546","Description":"A discussion platform leaks private information in GET requests.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23546"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP23","EntryName":"Exposed Data"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.","Reasons":["Acceptable-Use"]},"Notes":[{"Type":"Other","Note":"The query string for the URL could be saved in the browser's history, passed through Referers to other web sites, stored in web logs, or otherwise recorded in other sources.
