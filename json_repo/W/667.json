{"ID":"667","Name":"Improper Locking","Abstraction":"Class","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1305","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)"],"Note":"Inconsistent locking discipline can lead to deadlock."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
