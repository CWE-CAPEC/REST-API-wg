{"ID":"1241","Name":"Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The device uses an algorithm that is predictable and generates a pseudo-random number.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nPseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their registers have a finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating patterns. As a result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise their randomness or expose their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse engineering or tampering. It is highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure the security of encryption schemes. TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers because they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise, as sources to generate random numbers.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"330","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Technology","Class":"System on Chip","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"In many cases, the design originally defines a cryptographically secure random number generator, but is then changed during implementation due to unforeseen constraints."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Application Data"],"Likelihood":["High"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"A true random number generator should be specified for cryptographic algorithms."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"A true random number generator should be implemented for cryptographic algorithms."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"Suppose a cryptographic function expects random value to be supplied for the crypto algorithm."},{"BodyText":"During the implementation phase, due to space constraint, a cryptographically secure random-number-generator could not be used, and instead of using a TRNG (True Random Number Generator), a LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) is used to generate a random value.
