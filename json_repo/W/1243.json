Examples of these security-sensitive values include root keys, encryption keys, manufacturing-specific information, chip-manufacturer-specific information, and original-equipment-manufacturer (OEM) data. After the chip is powered on, these values are sensed from fuses and stored in temporary locations such as registers and local memories. These locations are typically access-control protected from untrusted agents capable of accessing them.

The operating system (OS) uses three AES keys to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data using this accelerator. These keys are sensitive data stored in fuses. The security of the OS will be compromised if any of these AES keys are leaked. During system bootup, these AES keys are sensed from fuses and stored in temporary hardware registers of the AES peripheral. Access to these temporary registers is disconnected during the debug state to prevent them from leaking through debug access. In this example (see the vulnerable code source), the registers key0, key1, and key2 are used to store the three AES keys (which are accessed through key_big0, key_big1, and key_big2 signals). The OS selects one of these three keys through the key_big signal, which is used by the AES engine."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Verilog","ExampleCode":"...\n assign key_big0 = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key0[0],\n key0[1], key0[2], key0[3], key0[4], key0[5]};\n\n assign key_big1 = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key1[0],\n key1[1], key1[2], key1[3], key1[4], key1[5]};\n\n\n **assign key_big2 = {key2[0], key2[1], key2[2],** \n\n **key2[3], key2[4], key2[5]};** \n ...\n\n **assign key_big = key_sel[1] ? key_big2 : ( key_sel[0] ?** \n\n **key_big1 : key_big0 );** \n ..."},{"BodyText":"The above code illustrates an instance of a vulnerable implementation for blocking AES key mechanism when the system is in debug mode (i.e., when debug_mode_i is asserted). During debug mode, key accesses through key_big0 and key_big1 are effectively disconnected, as their values are set to zero. However, the key accessed via the key_big2 signal remains accessible, creating a potential pathway for sensitive fuse data leakage, specifically AES key2, during debug mode. Furthermore, even though it is not strictly necessary to disconnect the key_big signal when entering debug mode (since disconnecting key_big0, key_big1, and key_big2 will inherently disconnect key_big), it is advisable, in line with the defense-in-depth strategy, to also sever the connection to key_big. This additional security measure adds an extra layer of protection and safeguards the AES keys against potential future modifications to the key_big logic."},{"BodyText":"To mitigate this, disconnect access through key_big2 and key_big during debug mode [REF-1367]."},{"Nature":"Good","Language":"Verilog","ExampleCode":"...\n assign key_big0 = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key0[0],\n key0[1], key0[2], key0[3], key0[4], key0[5]};\n\n assign key_big1 = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key1[0],\n key1[1], key1[2], key1[3], key1[4], key1[5]}; \n\n assign key_big2 = \n **debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 :**  {key2[0],\n key2[1], key2[2], key2[3], key2[4], key2[5]};\n ...\n assign key_big = \n **debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 :**  ( key_sel[1] ?\n key_big2 : ( key_sel[0] ? key_big1 : key_big0 ) );\n ..."}]}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["116","545"],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1366","Title":"aes0_wrapper.sv","PublicationYear":"2021","URL":"https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac21/blob/71103971e8204de6a61afc17d3653292517d32bf/piton/design/chip/tile/ariane/src/aes0/aes0_wrapper.sv#L56C1-L57C1","URLDate":"2023-07-15"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1367","Title":"fix cwe_1243 in aes0_wrapper.sv","PublicationYear":"2021","URL":"https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac21/blob/cde1d9d6888bffab21d4b405ccef61b19c58dd3c/piton/design/chip/tile/ariane/src/aes0/aes0_wrapper.sv#L56","URLDate":"2023-09-28"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
