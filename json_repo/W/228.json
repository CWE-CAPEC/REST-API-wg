Public vulnerability research generally focuses on the manipulations that generate invalid structure, instead of the weaknesses that are exploited by those manipulations. For example, a common attack involves making a request that omits a required field, which can trigger a crash in some cases. The crash could be due to a named chain such as CWE-690 (Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference), but public reports rarely cover this aspect of a vulnerability."},{"Type":"Theoretical","Note":"The validity of input could be roughly classified along \"syntactic\", \"semantic\", and \"lexical\" dimensions. If the specification requires that an input value should be delimited with the \"[\" and \"]\" square brackets, then any input that does not follow this specification would be syntactically invalid. If the input between the brackets is expected to be a number, but the letters \"aaa\" are provided, then the input is syntactically invalid. If the input is a number and enclosed in brackets, but the number is outside of the allowable range, then it is semantically invalid. The inter-relationships between these properties - and their associated weaknesses- need further exploration."}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"PLOVER","SubmissionDate":"2006-07-19","SubmissionVersion":"Draft 3","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2006-07-19"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"Eric Dalci","ModificationOrganization":"Cigital","ModificationDate":"2008-07-01","ModificationComment":"updated Time_of_Introduction"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-09-08","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Maintenance_Notes, Name, Relationships, Relevant_Properties, Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2009-03-10","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Name"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2011-06-01","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2011-06-27","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2012-05-11","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2014-02-18","ModificationComment":"updated Demonstrative_Examples"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2014-07-30","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-01-19","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-11-08","ModificationComment":"updated Relevant_Properties"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2021-03-15","ModificationComment":"updated Demonstrative_Examples, Maintenance_Notes, Theoretical_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated Detection_Factors, Relationships, Time_of_Introduction"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2024-02-29","ModificationComment":"updated Observed_Examples, Relationships","ModificationVersion":"4.14","ModificationReleaseDate":"2024-02-29"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2025-12-11","ModificationComment":"updated Applicable_Platforms, Weakness_Ordinalities","ModificationVersion":"4.19","ModificationReleaseDate":"2025-12-11"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Structure and Validity Problems","Date":"2008-09-09"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Failure to Handle Syntactically Invalid Structure","Date":"2009-03-10"}]}
