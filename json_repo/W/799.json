{"ID":"799","Name":"Improper Control of Interaction Frequency","Abstraction":"Class","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.","ExtendedDescription":"This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected. The actor could be a human or an automated process such as a virus or bot. This could be used to cause a denial of service, compromise program logic (such as limiting humans to a single vote), or other consequences. For example, an authentication routine might not limit the number of times an attacker can guess a password. Or, a web site might conduct a poll but only expect humans to vote a maximum of once a day.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"691","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Web Based","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Web Server","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"Insufficient anti-automation","Description":"The term \"insufficient anti-automation\" focuses primarly on non-human actors such as viruses or bots, but the scope of this CWE entry is broader."},{"Term":"Brute force","Description":"Vulnerabilities that can be targeted using brute force attacks are often symptomatic of this weakness."}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability","Access Control","Other"],"Impact":["DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)","Bypass Protection Mechanism","Other"]}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"In the following code a username and password is read from a socket and an attempt is made to authenticate the username and password.
