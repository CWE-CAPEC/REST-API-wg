In effect, unmaintained code can become obsolete.\n\n\nThis issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1357","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"ICS/OT","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Maintainability"]}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1212","Title":"A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components","PublicationYear":"2021","PublicationMonth":"09","PublicationDay":"24","Publisher":"OWASP","URL":"https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
