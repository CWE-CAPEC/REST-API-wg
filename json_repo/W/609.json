{"ID":"609","Name":"Double-Checked Locking","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.","ExtendedDescription":"Double-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"667","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"367","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Other"],"Impact":["Modify Application Data","Alter Execution Logic"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.

Before Java 1.5, only use of the synchronized keyword is known to work. Beginning in Java 1.5, use of the \"volatile\" keyword allows double-checked locking to work successfully, although there is some debate as to whether it achieves sufficient performance gains.
