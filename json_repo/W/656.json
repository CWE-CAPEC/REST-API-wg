{"ID":"656","Name":"Reliance on Security Through Obscurity","Abstraction":"Class","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product uses a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity, such that knowledge of its algorithms or key data is sufficient to defeat the mechanism.","ExtendedDescription":"This reliance on \"security through obscurity\" can produce resultant weaknesses if an attacker is able to reverse engineer the inner workings of the mechanism. Note that obscurity can be one small part of defense in depth, since it can create more work for an attacker; however, it is a significant risk if used as the primary means of protection.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"657","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"693","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"259","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"321","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"472","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"Never Assuming your secrets are safe"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability","Other"],"Impact":["Other"],"Note":"The security mechanism can be bypassed easily."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Always consider whether knowledge of your code or design is sufficient to break it.
