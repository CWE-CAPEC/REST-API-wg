{"ID":"208","Name":"Observable Timing Discrepancy","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.","ExtendedDescription":"In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"203","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"385","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"327","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"},{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic."},{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Access Control"],"Impact":["Read Application Data","Bypass Protection Mechanism"]}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-173","Entries":[{"IntroText":"Consider an example hardware module that checks a user-provided password to grant access to a user.
