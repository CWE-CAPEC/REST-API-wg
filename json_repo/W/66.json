Depending on their functionality, they could be alternate entities. They are not necessarily listed in directories.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"706","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"},{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Other"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tBytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tBinary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities \u0026 anomalies","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tWeb Application Scanner\n\t\tWeb Services Scanner\n\t\tDatabase Scanners","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tFuzz Tester\n\t\tFramework-based Fuzzer","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Manual Static Analysis - Source Code","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tHighly cost effective:\n```\n\n\t\tFocused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source\n\t\tManual Source Code Review (not inspections)","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Method":"Automated Static Analysis - Source Code","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tSource code Weakness Analyzer\n\t\tContext-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Architecture or Design Review","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR [REF-1479], the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tHighly cost effective:\n```\n\n\t\tFormal Methods / Correct-By-Construction\n\t```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tInspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)","Effectiveness":"High"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-227","Entries":[{"IntroText":"Consider a web server that uses the Apple HFS+ file system.
