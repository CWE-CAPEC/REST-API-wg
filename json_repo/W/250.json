Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Medium","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"269","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"657","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Mobile","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"\n\nREALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.\n"},{"Phase":"Installation"},{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"\n\nIf an application has this design problem, then it can be easier for the developer to make implementation-related errors such as CWE-271 (Privilege Dropping / Lowering Errors).

This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.\n\n\nAttach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Look for library functions and system calls that indicate when privileges are being raised or dropped. Look for accesses of resources that are restricted to normal users.\n","EffectivenessNotes":"Note that this technique is only useful for privilege issues related to system resources.
