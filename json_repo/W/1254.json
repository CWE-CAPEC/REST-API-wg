{"ID":"1254","Name":"Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation. If there is a comparison logic failure on one of these steps, the operation may be vulnerable to a timing attack that can result in the interception of the process for nefarious purposes.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nComparison logic is used to compare a variety of objects including passwords, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and responses to verification challenges. When comparison logic is implemented at a finer granularity (e.g., byte-by-byte comparison) and breaks in the case of a comparison failure, an attacker can exploit this implementation to identify when exactly the failure occurred. With multiple attempts, the attacker may be able to guesses the correct password/response to challenge and elevate their privileges.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"208","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"697","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Authorization"],"Impact":["Bypass Protection Mechanism"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"\n\nThe hardware designer should ensure that comparison logic is implemented so as to compare in one operation instead in smaller chunks.\n"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-173","Entries":[{"IntroText":"Consider an example hardware module that checks a user-provided password to grant access to a user.
