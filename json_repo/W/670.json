{"ID":"670","Name":"Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation","Abstraction":"Class","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The code contains a control flow path that does not reflect the algorithm that the path is intended to implement, leading to incorrect behavior any time this path is navigated.","ExtendedDescription":"This weakness captures cases in which a particular code segment is always incorrect with respect to the algorithm that it is implementing. For example, if a C programmer intends to include multiple statements in a single block but does not include the enclosing braces (CWE-483), then the logic is always incorrect. This issue is in contrast to most weaknesses in which the code usually behaves correctly, except when it is externally manipulated in malicious ways.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"691","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"This issue typically appears in rarely-tested code, since the \"always-incorrect\" nature will be detected as a bug during normal usage."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Other","Alter Execution Logic"]}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-180","Entries":[{"IntroText":"This code queries a server and displays its status when a request comes from an authorized IP address."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"PHP","ExampleCode":"```\n\t$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];\n\tif(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){\n\t\techo \"You are not authorized to view this page\";\n\t\thttp_redirect($errorPageURL);\n\t}\n\t$status = getServerStatus();\n\techo $status;\n```\n...*"},{"BodyText":"This code redirects unauthorized users, but continues to execute code after calling http_redirect().
