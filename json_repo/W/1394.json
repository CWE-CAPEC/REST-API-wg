{"ID":"1394","Name":"Use of Default Cryptographic Key","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.","ExtendedDescription":"It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1392","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Authentication"],"Impact":["Gain Privileges or Assume Identity"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Requirements"],"Description":"Prohibit use of default, hard-coded, or other values that do not vary for each installation of the product - especially for separate organizations.","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Force the administrator to change the credential upon installation.","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Phase":["Installation","Operation"],"Description":"The product administrator could change the defaults upon installation or during operation.","Effectiveness":"Moderate"}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2018-3825","Description":"cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-3825"},{"Reference":"CVE-2016-1561","Description":"backup storage product has a default SSH public key in the authorized_keys file, allowing root access","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-1561"},{"Reference":"CVE-2010-2306","Description":"Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2306"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
