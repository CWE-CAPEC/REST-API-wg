{"ID":"403","Name":"Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"A process does not close sensitive file descriptors before invoking a child process, which allows the child to perform unauthorized I/O operations using those descriptors.","ExtendedDescription":"When a new process is forked or executed, the child process inherits any open file descriptors. When the child process has fewer privileges than the parent process, this might introduce a vulnerability if the child process can access the file descriptor but does not have the privileges to access the associated file.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"402","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Unix","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"File descriptor leak","Description":"While this issue is frequently called a file descriptor leak, the \"leak\" term is often used in two different ways - exposure of a resource, or consumption of a resource.
