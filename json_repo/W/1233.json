{"ID":"1233","Name":"Security-Sensitive Hardware Controls with Missing Lock Bit Protection","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Stable","Description":"The product uses a register lock bit protection mechanism, but it does not ensure that the lock bit prevents modification of system registers or controls that perform changes to important hardware system configuration.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nIntegrated circuits and hardware intellectual properties (IPs) might provide device configuration controls that need to be programmed after device power reset by a trusted firmware or software module, commonly set by BIOS/bootloader. After reset, there can be an expectation that the controls cannot be used to perform any further modification. This behavior is commonly implemented using a trusted lock bit, which can be set to disable writes to a protected set of registers or address regions. The lock protection is intended to prevent modification of certain system configuration (e.g., memory/memory protection unit configuration).\n\n\nHowever, if the lock bit does not effectively write-protect all system registers or controls that could modify the protected system configuration, then an adversary may be able to use software to access the registers/controls and modify the protected hardware configuration.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"284","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"667","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"Such issues could be introduced during hardware architecture and design and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases."},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"Such issues could be introduced during implementation and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Access Control"],"Impact":["Modify Memory"],"Note":"System Configuration protected by the lock bit can be modified even when the lock is set."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Manual Analysis","Description":"Set the lock bit.
