{"ID":"622","Name":"Improper Validation of Function Hook Arguments","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product adds hooks to user-accessible API functions, but it does not properly validate the arguments. This could lead to resultant vulnerabilities.","ExtendedDescription":"Such hooks can be used in defensive software that runs with privileges, such as anti-virus or firewall, which hooks kernel calls. When the arguments are not validated, they could be used to bypass the protection scheme or attack the product itself.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"20","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Unexpected State"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Ensure that all arguments are verified, as defined by the API you are protecting."},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Drop privileges before invoking such functions, if possible."}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2007-0708","Description":"DoS in firewall using standard Microsoft functions","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0708"},{"Reference":"CVE-2006-7160","Description":"DoS in firewall using standard Microsoft functions","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-7160"},{"Reference":"CVE-2007-1376","Description":"function does not verify that its argument is the proper type, leading to arbitrary memory write","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-1376"},{"Reference":"CVE-2007-1220","Description":"invalid syscall arguments bypass code execution limits","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-1220"},{"Reference":"CVE-2006-4541","Description":"DoS in IDS via NULL argument","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4541"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP27","EntryName":"Tainted input to environment"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
