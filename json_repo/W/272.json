Any further allowance of privilege widens the window of time during which a successful exploitation of the system will provide an attacker with that same privilege. If at all possible, limit the allowance of system privilege to small, simple sections of code that may be called atomically.\n\n\nWhen a program calls a privileged function, such as chroot(), it must first acquire root privilege.
