However, this access should not also grant access to all of the internal TAPs (e.g., Core).

Architecture mandates that the user have one set of credentials for just accessing TAP_A, another set of credentials for accessing TAP_B and TAP_C, etc. However, if, during implementation, the designer mistakenly implements a daisy-chained TAP where all the TAPs are connected in a single TAP chain without the hierarchical structure, the correct granularity of debug components is not implemented and the attacker can gain unauthorized access."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2017-18347","Description":"Incorrect access control in RDP Level 1 on STMicroelectronics STM32F0 series devices allows physically present attackers to extract the device's protected firmware via a special sequence of Serial Wire Debug (SWD) commands because there is a race condition between full initialization of the SWD interface and the setup of flash protection.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-18347"},{"Reference":"CVE-2020-1791","Description":"There is an improper authorization vulnerability in several smartphones.
