Catching the resulting exception was easier than fixing the underlying problem.\n\n  - The program explicitly throws a NullPointerException to signal an error condition.\n\n  - The code is part of a test harness that supplies unexpected input to the classes under test.\n\nOf these three circumstances, only the last is acceptable.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"705","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"755","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tBytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis\n\t\tBinary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tFramework-based Fuzzer","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Manual Static Analysis - Source Code","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tManual Source Code Review (not inspections)","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Automated Static Analysis - Source Code","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tHighly cost effective:\n```\n\n\t\tSource code Weakness Analyzer\n\t\tContext-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Method":"Architecture or Design Review","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tHighly cost effective:\n```\n\n\t\tFormal Methods / Correct-By-Construction\n\t```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tInspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)","Effectiveness":"High"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design","Implementation"],"Description":"Do not extensively rely on catching exceptions (especially for validating user input) to handle errors.
