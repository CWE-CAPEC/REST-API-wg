{"ID":"460","Name":"Improper Cleanup on Thrown Exception","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product does not clean up its state or incorrectly cleans up its state when an exception is thrown, leading to unexpected state or control flow.","ExtendedDescription":"Often, when functions or loops become complicated, some level of resource cleanup is needed throughout execution.
