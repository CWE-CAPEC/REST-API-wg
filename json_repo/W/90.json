Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-210","Entries":[{"IntroText":"The code below constructs an LDAP query using user input address data:"},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Java","ExampleCode":"```\n\tcontext = new InitialDirContext(env);\n\tString searchFilter = \"StreetAddress=\" + address;\n\tNamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, searchFilter, searchCtls);\n```"},{"BodyText":"Because the code fails to neutralize the address string used to construct the query, an attacker can supply an address that includes additional LDAP queries."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2021-41232","Description":"Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41232"},{"Reference":"CVE-2005-2301","Description":"Server does not properly escape LDAP queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a DoS and possibly conduct an LDAP injection attack.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2301"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"LDAP injection"},{"TaxonomyName":"OWASP Top Ten 2007","EntryID":"A2","EntryName":"Injection Flaws","MappingFit":"CWE More Specific"},{"TaxonomyName":"WASC","EntryID":"29","EntryName":"LDAP Injection"},{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP24","EntryName":"Tainted input to command"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["136"],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-879","Authors":["SPI Dynamics"],"Title":"Web Applications and LDAP Injection"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
