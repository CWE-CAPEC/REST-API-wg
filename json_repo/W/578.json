{"ID":"578","Name":"EJB Bad Practices: Use of Class Loader","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using the class loader.","ExtendedDescription":"The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container. In this case, the product violates the following EJB guideline: \"The enterprise bean must not attempt to create a class loader; obtain the current class loader; set the context class loader; set security manager; create a new security manager; stop the JVM; or change the input, output, and error streams.\" The specification justifies this requirement in the following way: \"These functions are reserved for the EJB container. Allowing the enterprise bean to use these functions could compromise security and decrease the container's ability to properly manage the runtime environment.\"","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"573","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability","Other"],"Impact":["Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands","Varies by Context"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design","Implementation"],"Description":"Do not use the Class Loader when writing EJBs."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"The following Java example is a simple stateless Enterprise JavaBean that retrieves the interest rate for the number of points for a mortgage.
