{"ID":"693","Name":"Protection Mechanism Failure","Abstraction":"Pillar","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.","ExtendedDescription":"This weakness covers three distinct situations. A \"missing\" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An \"insufficient\" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an \"ignored\" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.","ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"ICS/OT","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Access Control"],"Impact":["Bypass Protection Mechanism"]}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["1","107","127","17","20","22","237","36","477","480","51","57","59","65","668","74","87"],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Discouraged","Rationale":"This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.","Comments":"Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.","Reasons":["Abstraction"]},"Notes":[{"Type":"Research Gap","Note":"The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively.
