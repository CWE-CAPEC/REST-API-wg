{"ID":"1048","Name":"Invokable Control Element with Large Number of Outward Calls","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The code contains callable control elements that\n         contain an excessively large number of references to other\n         application objects external to the context of the callable,\n         i.e. a Fan-Out value that is excessively large.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nWhile the interpretation of \"excessively large Fan-Out value\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 5 referenced objects.\n\n\nThis issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"710","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Maintainability"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCMM","EntryID":"ASCMM-MNT-4"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-960","Section":"ASCMM-MNT-4","Authors":["Object Management Group (OMG)"],"Title":"Automated Source Code Maintainability Measure (ASCMM)","PublicationYear":"2016","PublicationMonth":"01","URL":"https://www.omg.org/spec/ASCMM/","URLDate":"2023-04-07"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.","Comments":"Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.","Reasons":["Other"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Content Team","SubmissionOrganization":"MITRE","SubmissionDate":"2018-07-02","SubmissionComment":"Entry derived from Common Quality Enumeration (CQE) Draft 0.9.","SubmissionVersion":"3.2","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2019-01-03"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-08-20","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-01-31","ModificationComment":"updated Description"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated References, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2024-02-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes","ModificationVersion":"4.14","ModificationReleaseDate":"2024-02-29"}]}
