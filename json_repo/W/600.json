{"ID":"600","Name":"Uncaught Exception in Servlet ","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The Servlet does not catch all exceptions, which may reveal sensitive debugging information.","ExtendedDescription":"When a Servlet throws an exception, the default error response the Servlet container sends back to the user typically includes debugging information. This information is of great value to an attacker. For example, a stack trace might show the attacker a malformed SQL query string, the type of database being used, and the version of the application container. This information enables the attacker to target known vulnerabilities in these components.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"248","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"209","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"PeerOf","CweID":"390","ViewID":"1000"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"Missing Catch Block"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Availability"],"Impact":["Read Application Data","DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Implement Exception blocks to handle all types of Exceptions."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-39","Entries":[{"IntroText":"The following example attempts to resolve a hostname."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Java","ExampleCode":"```\n\tprotected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {\n\t\tString ip = req.getRemoteAddr();\n\t\tInetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);\n\t\t...\n\t\tout.println(\"hello \" + addr.getHostName());\n\t}\n```"},{"BodyText":"A DNS lookup failure will cause the Servlet to throw an exception."}]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)","EntryID":"ERR01-J","EntryName":"Do not allow exceptions to expose sensitive information"},{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP4","EntryName":"Unchecked Status Condition"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
