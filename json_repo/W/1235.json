For example, a compiler might convert an int to Integer (called autoboxing) or an Integer to int (called unboxing). This eliminates forcing the programmer to perform these conversions manually, which makes the code cleaner."],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"The programmer may use boxed primitives when not strictly necessary."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)","DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory)","DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)","Reduce Performance"],"Likelihood":["Low"],"Note":"Incorrect autoboxing/unboxing would result in reduced performance, which sometimes can lead to resource consumption issues, impacting availability when used with generic collections."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Use of boxed primitives should be limited to certain situations such as when calling methods with typed parameters. They should not be used for scientific computing or other performance critical operations. They are only suited to support \"impedance mismatch\" between reference types and primitives. Examine the use of boxed primitives prior to use. Use SparseArrays or ArrayMap instead of HashMap to avoid performance overhead."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"Java has a boxed primitive for each primitive type.
