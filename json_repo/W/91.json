Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)","Effectiveness":"High"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"MitigationID":"MIT-5","Phase":["Implementation"],"Strategy":"Input Validation","Description":"\n\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"XML injection (aka Blind Xpath injection)"},{"TaxonomyName":"OWASP Top Ten 2007","EntryID":"A2","EntryName":"Injection Flaws","MappingFit":"CWE More Specific"},{"TaxonomyName":"OWASP Top Ten 2004","EntryID":"A6","EntryName":"Injection Flaws","MappingFit":"CWE More Specific"},{"TaxonomyName":"WASC","EntryID":"23","EntryName":"XML Injection"},{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP24","EntryName":"Tainted input to command"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["250","83"],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-882","Authors":["Amit Klein"],"Title":"Blind XPath Injection","PublicationYear":"2004","PublicationMonth":"05","PublicationDay":"19","URL":"https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/bypass/Blind_XPath_Injection_20040518.pdf","URLDate":"2023-04-07"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-62","Section":"Chapter 17, \"XML Injection\", Page 1069","Authors":["Mark Dowd","John McDonald","Justin Schuh"],"Title":"The Art of Software Security Assessment","Edition":"1st Edition","PublicationYear":"2006","Publisher":"Addison Wesley"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
