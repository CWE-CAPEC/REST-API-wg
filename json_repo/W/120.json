The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the \"classic\" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"High","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"787","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"119","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"787","ViewID":"1305","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"787","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"123","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"20","ViewID":"700","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Resultant"},{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Language","Class":"Assembly","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"Classic Buffer Overflow","Description":"This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques."},{"Term":"Unbounded Transfer"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Confidentiality","Availability"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands"],"Note":"Buffer overflows often can be used to execute arbitrary code, which is usually outside the scope of the product's implicit security policy.
