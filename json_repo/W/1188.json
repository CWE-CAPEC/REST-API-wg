However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1419","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"665","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-163","Entries":[{"IntroText":"This code attempts to login a user using credentials from a POST request:"},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"PHP","ExampleCode":"```\n```\n// $user and $pass automatically set from POST request* \n\tif (login_user($user,$pass)) {\n\t```\n\t\t$authorized = true;\n\t}\n```\n...* \n\t\n\tif ($authorized) {\n\t```\n\t\tgeneratePage();\n\t}\n```"},{"BodyText":"Because the $authorized variable is never initialized, PHP will automatically set $authorized to any value included in the POST request if register_globals is enabled.
