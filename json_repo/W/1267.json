{"ID":"1267","Name":"Policy Uses Obsolete Encoding","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product uses an obsolete encoding mechanism to implement access controls.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nWithin a System-On-a-Chip (SoC), various circuits and hardware engines generate transactions for the purpose of accessing (read/write) assets or performing various actions (e.g., reset, fetch, compute, etc.). Among various types of message information, a typical transaction is comprised of source identity (identifying the originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (routing the transaction to the respective entity). Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a Security Token. This Security Token helps the destination agent decide on the set of allowed actions (e.g., access to an asset for reads and writes). A policy encoder is used to map the bus transactions to Security Tokens that in turn are used as access-controls/protection mechanisms. A common weakness involves using an encoding which is no longer trusted, i.e., an obsolete encoding.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"284","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability","Access Control"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","Read Memory","Modify Files or Directories","Read Files or Directories","DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands","Gain Privileges or Assume Identity","Bypass Protection Mechanism","Reduce Reliability"],"Likelihood":["High"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design","Implementation"],"Description":"\n\nSecurity Token Decoders should be reviewed for design inconsistency and common weaknesses.\n\n\nAccess and programming flows should be tested in both pre-silicon and post-silicon testing.\n","Effectiveness":"High"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"For example, consider a system that has four bus masters.
