This results in traffic being broadcast to an eavesdropper, instead of being sent only on the relevant switch interface. To mitigate this type of problem, the developer could limit the number of ARP entries that can be recorded for a given switch interface, while other interfaces may keep functioning normally. Configuration options can be provided on the appropriate actions to be taken in case of a detected failure, but safe defaults should be used."}]},{"ID":"DX-165","Entries":[{"IntroText":"The IPSEC specification is complex, which resulted in bugs, partial implementations, and incompatibilities between vendors."}]},{"ID":"DX-166","Entries":[{"IntroText":"When executable library files are used on web servers, which is common in PHP applications, the developer might perform an access check in any user-facing executable, and omit the access check from the library file itself.
