{"ID":"1317","Name":"Improper Access Control in Fabric Bridge","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product uses a fabric bridge for transactions between two Intellectual Property (IP) blocks, but the bridge does not properly perform the expected privilege, identity, or other access control checks between those IP blocks.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nIn hardware designs, different IP blocks are connected through interconnect-bus fabrics (e.g. AHB and OCP). Within a System on Chip (SoC), the IP block subsystems could be using different bus protocols. In such a case, the IP blocks are then linked to the central bus (and to other IP blocks) through a fabric bridge. Bridges are used as bus-interconnect-routing modules that link different protocols or separate, different segments of the overall SoC interconnect.\n\n\nFor overall system security, it is important that the access-control privileges associated with any fabric transaction are consistently maintained and applied, even when they are routed or translated by a fabric bridge. A bridge that is connected to a fabric without security features forwards transactions to the slave without checking the privilege level of the master and results in a weakness in SoC access-control security. The same weakness occurs if a bridge does not check the hardware identity of the transaction received from the slave interface of the bridge.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"284","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Processor Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Access Control","Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart","Bypass Protection Mechanism","Read Memory","Modify Memory"],"Likelihood":["Medium"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Simulation / Emulation","Description":"RTL simulation to ensure that bridge-access controls are implemented properly.","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Method":"Formal Verification","Description":"Formal verification of bridge RTL to ensure that access control cannot be bypassed.","Effectiveness":"High"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Ensure that the design includes provisions for access-control checks in the bridge for both upstream and downstream transactions."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Implement access-control checks in the bridge for both upstream and downstream transactions."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"This example is from CVE-2019-6260 [REF-1138].

It also shows a correct implementation of access control for the AES peripheral (see module aes0_wrapper) [REF-1381]. An enable signal (en_o) from the fabric's AXI interface (present in both modules) is used to determine if an access request is made to the peripheral. In the case of the AES peripheral, this en_o signal is first received in a temporary signal en_acct. Then, the access request is enabled (by asserting the en signal) only if the request has sufficient access permissions (i.e., acct_ctrl_i signal should be enabled). However, in the case of the CLINT peripheral, the enable signal, en_o, from the AXI interface, is directly used to enable accesses.
