Within the developer and other communities, \"randomness\" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, \"entropy\" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios."}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CLASP","SubmissionDate":"2006-07-19","SubmissionVersion":"Draft 3","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2006-07-19"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"Eric Dalci","ModificationOrganization":"Cigital","ModificationDate":"2008-07-01","ModificationComment":"updated Time_of_Introduction"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-09-08","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences, Relationships, Other_Notes, Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2009-05-27","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Name"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2009-10-29","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Other_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2011-06-01","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences, Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2012-05-11","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2012-10-30","ModificationComment":"updated Demonstrative_Examples"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-11-08","ModificationComment":"updated Applicable_Platforms, Likelihood_of_Exploit, Modes_of_Introduction, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2019-01-03","ModificationComment":"updated Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated References, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2021-07-20","ModificationComment":"updated Maintenance_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2024-02-29","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships","ModificationVersion":"4.14","ModificationReleaseDate":"2024-02-29"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Failure of TRNG","Date":"2008-04-11"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Failure to Handle Insufficient Entropy in TRNG","Date":"2009-05-27"}]}
