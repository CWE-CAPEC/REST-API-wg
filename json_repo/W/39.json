Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"MitigationID":"MIT-5.1","Phase":["Implementation"],"Strategy":"Input Validation","Description":"\n\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\n\nWhen validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.\n","Effectiveness":"High"},{"MitigationID":"MIT-20","Phase":["Implementation"],"Strategy":"Input Validation","Description":"Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked."}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2001-0038","Description":"Remote attackers can read arbitrary files by specifying the drive letter in the requested URL.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0038"},{"Reference":"CVE-2001-0255","Description":"FTP server allows remote attackers to list arbitrary directories by using the \"ls\" command and including the drive letter name (e.g. C:) in the requested pathname.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0255"},{"Reference":"CVE-2001-0687","Description":"FTP server allows a remote attacker to retrieve privileged system information by specifying arbitrary paths.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0687"},{"Reference":"CVE-2001-0933","Description":"FTP server allows remote attackers to list the contents of arbitrary drives via a ls command that includes the drive letter as an argument.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0933"},{"Reference":"CVE-2002-0466","Description":"Server allows remote attackers to browse arbitrary directories via a full pathname in the arguments to certain dynamic pages.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0466"},{"Reference":"CVE-2002-1483","Description":"Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via an HTTP request whose argument is a filename of the form \"C:\" (Drive letter), \"//absolute/path\", or \"..\" .","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1483"},{"Reference":"CVE-2004-2488","Description":"FTP server read/access arbitrary files using \"C:\\\" filenames","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2488"}],"FunctionalAreas":["File Processing"],"AffectedResources":["File or Directory"],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"'C:dirname' or C: (Windows volume or 'drive letter')"},{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"FIO05-C","EntryName":"Identify files using multiple file attributes"},{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP16","EntryName":"Path Traversal"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
