{"ID":"671","Name":"Lack of Administrator Control over Security","Abstraction":"Class","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product uses security features in a way that prevents the product's administrator from tailoring security settings to reflect the environment in which the product is being used. This introduces resultant weaknesses or prevents it from operating at a level of security that is desired by the administrator.","ExtendedDescription":"If the product's administrator does not have the ability to manage security-related decisions at all times, then protecting the product from outside threats - including the product's developer - can become impossible. For example, a hard-coded account name and password cannot be changed by the administrator, thus exposing that product to attacks that the administrator can not prevent.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"657","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase."},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Varies by Context"]}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-14","Entries":[{"IntroText":"The following code is an example of an internal hard-coded password in the back-end:"},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"C","ExampleCode":"```\n\tint VerifyAdmin(char *password) {\n\t\t\tif (strcmp(password, \"Mew!\")) {\n\t\t\t\t\t printf(\"Incorrect Password!\\n\");\n\t\t\t\t\treturn(0)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tprintf(\"Entering Diagnostic Mode...\\n\");\n\t\t\treturn(1);\n\t}\n```"},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Java","ExampleCode":"```\n\tint VerifyAdmin(String password) {\n\t\tif (!password.equals(\"Mew!\")) {\n\t\t\treturn(0)\n\t\t}\n\t\t//Diagnostic Mode\n\t\treturn(1);\n\t}\n```"},{"BodyText":"Every instance of this program can be placed into diagnostic mode with the same password.
