{"ID":"497","Name":"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nNetwork-based products, such as web applications, often run on top of an operating system or similar environment. When the product communicates with outside parties, details about the underlying system are expected to remain hidden, such as path names for data files, other OS users, installed packages, the application environment, etc. This system information may be provided by the product itself, or buried within diagnostic or debugging messages. Debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system and form an attack plan.\n\n\nAn information exposure occurs when system data or debugging information leaves the program through an output stream or logging function that makes it accessible to unauthorized parties. Using other weaknesses, an attacker could cause errors to occur; the response to these errors can reveal detailed system information, along with other impacts. An attacker can use messages that reveal technologies, operating systems, and product versions to tune the attack against known vulnerabilities in these technologies. A product may use diagnostic methods that provide significant implementation details such as stack traces as part of its error handling mechanism.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"200","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Application Data"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
