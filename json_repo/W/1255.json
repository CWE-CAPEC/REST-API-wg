{"ID":"1255","Name":"Comparison Logic is Vulnerable to Power Side-Channel Attacks","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"A device's real time power consumption may be monitored during security token evaluation and the information gleaned may be used to determine the value of the reference token.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThe power consumed by a device may be instrumented and monitored in real time. If the algorithm for evaluating security tokens is not sufficiently robust, the power consumption may vary by token entry comparison against the reference value. Further, if retries are unlimited, the power difference between a \"good\" entry and a \"bad\" entry may be observed and used to determine whether each entry itself is correct thereby allowing unauthorized parties to calculate the reference value.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1300","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"PeerOf","CweID":"1259","ViewID":"1194","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"},{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"The design of the algorithm itself may intrinsically allow the power side channel attack to be effective."},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"This weakness may be introduced during implementation despite a robust design that otherwise prevents exploitation."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability","Access Control","Accountability","Authentication","Authorization","Non-Repudiation"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","Read Memory","Read Files or Directories","Modify Files or Directories","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands","Gain Privileges or Assume Identity","Bypass Protection Mechanism","Read Application Data","Modify Application Data","Hide Activities"],"Note":"As compromising a security token may result in complete system control, the impacts are relatively universal."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"The design phase must consider each check of a security token against a standard and the amount of power consumed during the check of a good token versus a bad token.
