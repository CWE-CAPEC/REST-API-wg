{"ID":"385","Name":"Covert Timing Channel","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nIn some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.\n\n\nCovert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.\n","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Medium","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"514","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Other"],"Impact":["Read Application Data","Other"],"Note":"Information exposure."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Whenever possible, specify implementation strategies that do not introduce time variances in operations."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Often one can artificially manipulate the time which operations take or -- when operations occur -- can remove information from the attacker."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"It is reasonable to add artificial or random delays so that the amount of CPU time consumed is independent of the action being taken by the application."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-193","Entries":[{"IntroText":"In this example, the attacker observes how long an authentication takes when the user types in the correct password."},{"BodyText":"When the attacker tries their own values, they can first try strings of various length. When they find a string of the right length, the computation will take a bit longer, because the for loop will run at least once. Additionally, with this code, the attacker can possibly learn one character of the password at a time, because when they guess the first character right, the computation will take longer than a wrong guesses. Such an attack can break even the most sophisticated password with a few hundred guesses."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Python","ExampleCode":"```\n\tdef validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw): \n\t\t\tif len(actual_pw) \u003c\u003e len(typed_pw): \n\t\t\t\treturn 0\n\t\t\tfor i in len(actual_pw): \n\t\t\t\tif actual_pw[i] \u003c\u003e typed_pw[i]: \n\t\t\t\t\treturn 0\n\t\t\treturn 1\n```"},{"BodyText":"Note that in this example, the actual password must be handled in constant time as far as the attacker is concerned, even if the actual password is of an unusual length.
