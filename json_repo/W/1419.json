Examples include a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not, or a register or fuse value that determines the security state of the product.\n\n\nFor software, this weakness can frequently occur when implicit initialization is used, meaning the resource is not explicitly set to a specific value. For example, in C, memory is not necessarily cleared when it is allocated on the stack, and many scripting languages use a default empty, null value, or zero value when a variable is not explicitly initialized.\n\n\nFor hardware, this weakness frequently appears with reset values and fuses. After a product reset, hardware may initialize registers incorrectly. During different phases of a product lifecycle, fuses may be set to incorrect values. Even if fuses are set to correct values, the lines to the fuse could be broken or there might be hardware on the fuse line that alters the fuse value to be incorrect.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"665","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"},{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Manufacturing"},{"Phase":"Installation"},{"Phase":"System Configuration"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Memory","Read Application Data","Unexpected State"],"Likelihood":["Unknown"]},{"Scope":["Authorization","Integrity"],"Impact":["Gain Privileges or Assume Identity"]},{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Varies by Context"],"Note":"The technical impact can vary widely based on how the resource is used in the product, and whether its contents affect security decisions."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
