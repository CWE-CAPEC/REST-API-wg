{"ID":"1073","Name":"Non-SQL Invokable Control Element with Excessive Number of Data Resource Accesses","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product contains a client with a function or method that contains a large number of data accesses/queries that are sent through a data manager, i.e., does not use efficient database capabilities.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n\n\nWhile the interpretation of \"large number of data accesses/queries\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 2 data accesses per function/method.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"405","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Performance"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCPEM","EntryID":"ASCPEM-PRF-10"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-959","Section":"ASCPEM-PRF-10","Authors":["Object Management Group (OMG)"],"Title":"Automated Source Code Performance Efficiency Measure (ASCPEM)","PublicationYear":"2016","PublicationMonth":"01","URL":"https://www.omg.org/spec/ASCPEM/","URLDate":"2023-04-07"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.","Comments":"Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.","Reasons":["Other"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Content Team","SubmissionOrganization":"MITRE","SubmissionDate":"2018-07-02","SubmissionComment":"Entry derived from Common Quality Enumeration (CQE) Draft 0.9.","SubmissionVersion":"3.2","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2019-01-03"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-08-20","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-01-31","ModificationComment":"updated Description"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated References, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2024-02-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes","ModificationVersion":"4.14","ModificationReleaseDate":"2024-02-29"}]}
