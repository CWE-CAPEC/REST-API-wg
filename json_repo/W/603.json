Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications."},{"BodyText":"Multiple vendors used client-side authentication in their OT products."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2022-33139","Description":"SCADA system only uses client-side authentication, allowing adversaries to impersonate other users.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-33139"},{"Reference":"CVE-2006-0230","Description":"Client-side check for a password allows access to a server using crafted XML requests from a modified client.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-0230"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-62","Section":"Chapter 2, \"Untrustworthy Credentials\", Page 37","Authors":["Mark Dowd","John McDonald","Justin Schuh"],"Title":"The Art of Software Security Assessment","Edition":"1st Edition","PublicationYear":"2006","Publisher":"Addison Wesley"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1283","Authors":["Forescout Vedere Labs"],"Title":"OT:ICEFALL: The legacy of \"insecure by design\" and its implications for certifications and risk management","PublicationYear":"2022","PublicationMonth":"06","PublicationDay":"20","URL":"https://www.forescout.com/resources/ot-icefall-report/"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
