While an analyst could examine memory to see that it has not been scrubbed, an analysis of the executable would not be successful. This is because the compiler has already removed the relevant code. Only the source code shows whether the programmer intended to clear the memory or not, so this weakness is indistinguishable from others.","Effectiveness":"Limited"},{"Method":"White Box","Description":"This weakness is only detectable using white box methods (see black box detection factor). Careful analysis is required to determine if the code is likely to be removed by the compiler."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-200","Entries":[{"IntroText":"The following code reads a password from the user, uses the password to connect to a back-end mainframe, and then attempts to scrub the password from memory using memset()."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"C","ExampleCode":"void GetData(char *MFAddr) { \n```\n\t char pwd[64];\n\t if (GetPasswordFromUser(pwd, sizeof(pwd))) { \n\t\t if (ConnectToMainframe(MFAddr, pwd)) { \n```\n// Interaction with mainframe*  }  }\n\t memset(pwd, 0, sizeof(pwd));  }"},{"BodyText":"The code in the example will behave correctly if it is executed verbatim, but if the code is compiled using an optimizing compiler, then the call to memset() might be removed as a dead store, because the buffer pwd is not used after its value is overwritten. Because the buffer pwd contains a sensitive value, the application may be vulnerable to attack if the data are left memory resident. If attackers are able to access the correct region of memory, they may use the recovered password to gain control of the system."},{"BodyText":"It is common practice to overwrite sensitive data manipulated in memory, such as passwords or cryptographic keys, in order to prevent attackers from learning system secrets. However, with the advent of optimizing compilers, programs do not always behave as their source code alone would suggest. In the example, the compiler interprets the call to memset() as dead code because the memory being written to is not subsequently used, despite the fact that there is clearly a security motivation for the operation to occur. The problem here is that many compilers, and in fact many programming languages, do not take this and other security concerns into consideration in their efforts to improve efficiency."},{"BodyText":"Attackers typically exploit this type of vulnerability by using a core dump or runtime mechanism to access the memory used by a particular application and recover the secret information. Once an attacker has access to the secret information, it is relatively straightforward to further exploit the system and possibly compromise other resources with which the application interacts."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2008-1685","Description":"C compiler optimization, as allowed by specifications, removes code that is used to perform checks to detect integer overflows.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1685"},{"Reference":"CVE-2019-1010006","Description":"Chain: compiler optimization (CWE-733) removes or modifies code used to detect integer overflow (CWE-190), allowing out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1010006"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["10","24","46","8","9"],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-7","Section":"Chapter 9, \"A Compiler Optimization Caveat\" Page 322","Authors":["Michael Howard","David LeBlanc"],"Title":"Writing Secure Code","Edition":"2nd Edition","PublicationYear":"2002","PublicationMonth":"12","PublicationDay":"04","Publisher":"Microsoft Press","URL":"https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/writing-secure-code-9780735617223"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
