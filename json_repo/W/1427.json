Because LLMs are designed to treat all instructions as legitimate, there is often no way for the model to differentiate between what prompt language is malicious when it performs inference and returns data. Many LLM systems incorporate data from other adjacent products or external data sources like Wikipedia using API calls and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Any external sources in use that may contain untrusted data should also be considered potentially malicious. \n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"77","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"AI/ML","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"prompt injection","Description":"attack-oriented term for modifying prompts, whether due to this weakness or other weaknesses"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"\n\nLLM-connected applications that do not distinguish between trusted and untrusted input may introduce this weakness.
