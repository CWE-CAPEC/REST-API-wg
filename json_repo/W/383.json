{"ID":"383","Name":"J2EE Bad Practices: Direct Use of Threads","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"Thread management in a Web application is forbidden in some circumstances and is always highly error prone.","ExtendedDescription":"Thread management in a web application is forbidden by the J2EE standard in some circumstances and is always highly error prone. Managing threads is difficult and is likely to interfere in unpredictable ways with the behavior of the application container. Even without interfering with the container, thread management usually leads to bugs that are hard to detect and diagnose like deadlock, race conditions, and other synchronization errors.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"695","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Web Based","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Web Server","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Quality Degradation"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
