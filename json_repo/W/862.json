Different operating systems implement (ACLs) in different ways. In UNIX, there are three types of permissions: read, write, and execute. Users are divided into three classes for file access: owner, group owner, and all other users where each class has a separate set of rights. In Windows NT, there are four basic types of permissions for files: \"No access\", \"Read access\", \"Change access\", and \"Full control\". Windows NT extends the concept of three types of users in UNIX to include a list of users and groups along with their associated permissions.
