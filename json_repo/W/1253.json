{"ID":"1253","Name":"Incorrect Selection of Fuse Values","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The logic level used to set a system to a secure state relies on a fuse being unblown.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nFuses are often used to store secret data, including security configuration data. When not blown, a fuse is considered to store a logic 0, and, when blown, it indicates a logic 1. Fuses are generally considered to be one-directional, i.e., once blown to logic 1, it cannot be reset to logic 0.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"693","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Access Control","Authorization"],"Impact":["Bypass Protection Mechanism","Gain Privileges or Assume Identity"],"Note":"If the logic used to determine system-security state (by leveraging the values sensed from the fuses) uses negative logic, an attacker might blow the fuse and drive the system to an insecure state."},{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"]},{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Memory"]},{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Logic should be designed in a way that blown fuses do not put the product into an insecure state that can be leveraged by an attacker."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"A chip implements a secure boot and uses the sensed value of a fuse \"do_secure_boot\" to determine whether to perform a secure boot or not. If this fuse value is \"0\", the system performs secure boot. Otherwise, it does not perform secure boot.\n\n\nAn attacker blows the \"do_secure_boot\" fuse to \"1\". After reset, the attacker loads a custom bootloader, and, since the fuse value is now \"1\", the system does not perform secure boot, and the attacker can execute their custom firmware image.\n\n\nSince by default, a fuse-configuration value is a \"0\", an attacker can blow it to a \"1\" with inexpensive hardware.\n\n\nIf the logic is reversed, an attacker cannot easily reset the fuse.
