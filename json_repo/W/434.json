Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications.

As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\n\nFor example, limiting filenames to alphanumeric characters can help to restrict the introduction of unintended file extensions.\n"},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Define a very limited set of allowable extensions and only generate filenames that end in these extensions.
