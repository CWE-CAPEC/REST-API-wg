Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["System Configuration"],"Description":"Disable or change default settings when they can be used to abuse the system.
