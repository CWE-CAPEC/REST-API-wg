When the interpreter kills the process/thread, it might report an error containing detailed information such as the application's installation path."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)","Effectiveness":"High"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Ensure an end condition will be reached under all logic conditions. The end condition may include testing against the depth of recursion and exiting with an error if the recursion goes too deep. The complexity of the end condition contributes to the effectiveness of this action.","Effectiveness":"Moderate"},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Increase the stack size.","Effectiveness":"Limited","EffectivenessNotes":"Increasing the stack size might only be a temporary measure, since the stack typically is still not very large, and it might remain easy for attackers to cause an out-of-stack fault."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-204","Entries":[{"IntroText":"In this example a mistake exists in the code where the exit condition contained in flg is never called.
