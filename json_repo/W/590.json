{"ID":"590","Name":"Free of Memory not on the Heap","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product calls free() on a pointer to memory that was not allocated using associated heap allocation functions such as malloc(), calloc(), or realloc().","ExtendedDescription":"When free() is called on an invalid pointer, the program's memory management data structures may become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, an attacker may be able to cause free() to operate on controllable memory locations to modify critical program variables or execute code.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"762","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"123","ViewID":"1000"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Confidentiality","Availability"],"Impact":["Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands","Modify Memory"],"Note":"There is the potential for arbitrary code execution with privileges of the vulnerable program via a \"write, what where\" primitive. If pointers to memory which hold user information are freed, a malicious user will be able to write 4 bytes anywhere in memory."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-13","Method":"Fuzzing","Description":"Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.","Effectiveness":"High"},{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
