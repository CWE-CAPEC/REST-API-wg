It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1078","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Maintainability"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Verify that each comment accurately reflects what is intended to happen during execution of the code."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"In the following Java example the code performs a calculation to determine how much medicine to administer.
