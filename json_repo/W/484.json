{"ID":"484","Name":"Omitted Break Statement in Switch","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product omits a break statement within a switch or similar construct, causing code associated with multiple conditions to execute. This can cause problems when the programmer only intended to execute code associated with one condition.","ExtendedDescription":"This can lead to critical code executing in situations where it should not.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Medium","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"710","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"670","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"},{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C#","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"PHP","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Alter Execution Logic"],"Note":"This weakness can cause unintended logic to be executed and other unexpected application behavior."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"White Box","Description":"Omission of a break statement might be intentional, in order to support fallthrough.

Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)","Effectiveness":"High"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Omitting a break statement so that one may fall through is often indistinguishable from an error, and therefore should be avoided. If you need to use fall-through capabilities, make sure that you have clearly documented this within the switch statement, and ensure that you have examined all the logical possibilities."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"The functionality of omitting a break statement could be clarified with an if statement.
