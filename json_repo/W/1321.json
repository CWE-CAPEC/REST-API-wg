{"ID":"1321","Name":"Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nBy adding or modifying attributes of an object prototype, it is possible to create attributes that exist on every object, or replace critical attributes with malicious ones. This can be problematic if the product depends on existence or non-existence of certain attributes, or uses pre-defined attributes of object prototype (such as hasOwnProperty, toString or valueOf).\n\n\nThis weakness is usually exploited by using a special attribute of objects called proto, constructor or prototype. Such attributes give access to the object prototype. This weakness is often found in code that assigns object attributes based on user input, or merges or clones objects recursively.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"915","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"913","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"471","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"JavaScript","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Modify Application Data"],"Likelihood":["High"],"Note":"An attacker can inject attributes that are used in other components."},{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"],"Likelihood":["High"],"Note":"An attacker can override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible type, which may lead to a crash."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"By freezing the object prototype first (for example, Object.freeze(Object.prototype)), modification of the prototype becomes impossible.","Effectiveness":"High","EffectivenessNotes":"While this can mitigate this weakness completely, other methods are recommended when possible, especially in components used by upstream software (\"libraries\")."},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"By blocking modifications of attributes that resolve to object prototype, such as proto or prototype, this weakness can be mitigated.","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Strategy":"Input Validation","Description":"When handling untrusted objects, validating using a schema can be used.","Effectiveness":"Limited"},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"By using an object without prototypes (via Object.create(null) ), adding object prototype attributes by accessing the prototype via the special attributes becomes impossible, mitigating this weakness.","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Map can be used instead of objects in most cases.
