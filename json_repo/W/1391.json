{"ID":"1391","Name":"Use of Weak Credentials","Abstraction":"Class","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nBy design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1390","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"ICS/OT","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Requirements"},{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Installation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-153","Entries":[{"IntroText":"In 2022, the OT:ICEFALL study examined products by 10 different Operational Technology (OT) vendors.
