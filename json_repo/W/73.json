For example, ID 1 could map to \"inbox.txt\" and ID 2 could map to \"profile.txt\". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap provide this capability."},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design","Operation"],"Description":"\n\nRun your code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict all access to files within a particular directory.\n\n\nExamples include the Unix chroot jail and AppArmor. In general, managed code may provide some protection.\n\n\nThis may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of your application may still be subject to compromise.\n\n\nBe careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.\n"},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server."},{"MitigationID":"MIT-5.1","Phase":["Implementation"],"Strategy":"Input Validation","Description":"\n\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\n\nWhen validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.\n","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes \"..\" sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59)."},{"Phase":["Installation","Operation"],"Description":"Use OS-level permissions and run as a low-privileged user to limit the scope of any successful attack."},{"Phase":["Operation","Implementation"],"Description":"If you are using PHP, configure your application so that it does not use register_globals.

This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n"}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"7 Pernicious Kingdoms","SubmissionDate":"2006-07-19","SubmissionVersion":"Draft
