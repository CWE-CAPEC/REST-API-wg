If the product uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted product would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the product trusts.\n\n\nSome of the most common variants of untrusted search path are:\n\n\n  - In various UNIX and Linux-based systems, the PATH environment variable may be consulted to locate executable programs, and LD_PRELOAD may be used to locate a separate library.\n\n  - In various Microsoft-based systems, the PATH environment variable is consulted to locate a DLL, if the DLL is not found in other paths that appear earlier in the search order.\n\n","LikelihoodOfExploit":"High","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"642","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"668","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"673","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"PeerOf","CweID":"427","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"PeerOf","CweID":"428","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"Untrusted Path"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Confidentiality","Availability","Access Control"],"Impact":["Gain Privileges or Assume Identity","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands"],"Note":"There is the potential for arbitrary code execution with privileges of the vulnerable program."},{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"],"Note":"The program could be redirected to the wrong files, potentially triggering a crash or hang when the targeted file is too large or does not have the expected format."},{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Files or Directories"],"Note":"The program could send the output of unauthorized files to the attacker."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-11","Method":"Black Box","Description":"\n\nUse monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.\n\n\nAttach the monitor to the process and look for library functions and system calls that suggest when a search path is being used. One pattern is when the program performs multiple accesses of the same file but in different directories, with repeated failures until the proper filename is found. Library calls such as getenv() or their equivalent can be checked to see if any path-related variables are being accessed.\n"},{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
