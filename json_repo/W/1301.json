{"ID":"1301","Name":"Insufficient or Incomplete Data Removal within Hardware Component","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product's data removal process does not completely delete all data and potentially sensitive information within hardware components.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nPhysical properties of hardware devices, such as remanence of magnetic media, residual charge of ROMs/RAMs, or screen burn-in may still retain sensitive data after a data removal process has taken place and power is removed.\n\n\nRecovering data after erasure or overwriting is possible due to a phenomenon called data remanence. For example, if the same value is written repeatedly to a memory location, the corresponding memory cells can become physically altered to a degree such that even after the original data is erased that data can still be recovered through physical characterization of the memory cells.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"226","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Memory","Read Application Data"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Apply blinding or masking techniques to implementations of cryptographic algorithms."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Alter the method of erasure, add protection of media, or destroy the media to protect the data."}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2019-8575","Description":"Firmware Data Deletion Vulnerability in which a base station factory reset might not delete all user information.
