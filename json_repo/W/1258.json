The keys for these operations or the intermediate values are stored in registers internal to the cryptographic core.

These registers are accessible through the debug and test interface."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Other","ExampleCode":"In the above scenario, registers that store keys and intermediate values of cryptographic operations are not cleared when system enters debug mode.

Within this wrapper module are four memory-mapped registers: core_key, core_key0, core_key1, and core_key2. Core_key0, core_key1, and core_key2 hold encryption/decryption keys. The core_key register selects a key and sends it to the underlying AES module to execute encryption/decryption operations.\n\n\nDebug mode in processors and SoCs facilitates design debugging by granting access to internal signal/register values, including physical pin values of peripherals/core, fabric bus data transactions, and inter-peripheral registers. Debug mode allows users to gather detailed, low-level information about the design to diagnose potential issues. While debug mode is beneficial for diagnosing processors or SoCs, it also introduces a new attack surface for potential attackers. For instance, if an attacker gains access to debug mode, they could potentially read any content transmitted through the fabric bus or access encryption/decryption keys stored in cryptographic peripherals.\n\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to clear the contents of secret registers upon entering debug mode. In the provided example of flawed code below, when debug_mode_i is activated, the register core_key0 is set to zero to prevent AES key leakage during debugging. However, this protective measure is not applied to the core_key1 register [REF-1435], leaving its contents uncleared during debug mode. This oversight enables a debugger to access sensitive information. Failing to clear sensitive data during debug mode may lead to unauthorized access to secret keys and compromise system security."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Verilog","ExampleCode":"module aes1_wrapper #(\n ...\n\n```\n\t assign core_key0 = debug_mode_i ?
