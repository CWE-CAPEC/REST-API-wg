{"ID":"1234","Name":"Hardware Internal or Debug Modes Allow Override of Locks","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"System configuration protection may be bypassed during debug mode.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nDevice configuration controls are commonly programmed after a device power reset by a trusted firmware or software module (e.g., BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further modification. This is commonly implemented using a trusted lock bit, which when set, disables writes to a protected set of registers or address regions. The lock protection is intended to prevent modification of certain system configuration (e.g., memory/memory protection unit configuration). If debug features supported by hardware or internal modes/system states are supported in the hardware design, modification of the lock protection may be allowed allowing access and modification of configuration information.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"667","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Access Control"],"Impact":["Bypass Protection Mechanism"],"Likelihood":["High"],"Note":"Bypass of lock bit allows access and modification of system configuration even when the lock bit is set."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design","Implementation","Testing"],"Description":"\n\n  - Security Lock bit protections should be reviewed for any bypass/override modes supported.\n\n  - Any supported override modes either should be removed or protected using authenticated debug modes.\n\n  - Security lock programming flow and lock properties should be tested in pre-silicon and post-silicon testing.\n\n","Effectiveness":"High"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"For example, consider the example Locked_override_register example.

It demonstrates how to lock read or write access to security-critical hardware registers (e.g., crypto keys, system integrity code, etc.). The configuration to lock all the sensitive registers in the SoC is managed through the reglk_mem registers. These reglk_mem registers are reset when the hardware powers up and configured during boot up. Malicious users, even with kernel-level software privilege, do not get access to the sensitive contents that are locked down.
