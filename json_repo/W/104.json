{"ID":"104","Name":"Struts: Form Bean Does Not Extend Validation Class","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"If a form bean does not extend an ActionForm subclass of the Validator framework, it can expose the application to other weaknesses related to insufficient input validation.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"573","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"20","ViewID":"700","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"BackgroundDetails":["In order to use the Struts Validator, a form must extend one of the following: ValidatorForm, ValidatorActionForm, DynaValidatorActionForm, and DynaValidatorForm. One of these classes must be extended because the Struts Validator ties in to the application by implementing the validate() method in these classes. Forms derived from the ActionForm and DynaActionForm classes cannot use the Struts Validator."],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Other"],"Note":"Bypassing the validation framework for a form exposes the application to numerous types of attacks. Unchecked input is an important component of vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, process control, and SQL injection."},{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability","Other"],"Impact":["Other"],"Note":"Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.

When using the Struts framework to maintain user data in an ActionForm Bean, the class should always extend one of the validator classes, ValidatorForm, ValidatorActionForm, DynaValidatorForm or DynaValidatorActionForm.
