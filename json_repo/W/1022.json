{"ID":"1022","Name":"Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The web application produces links to untrusted external sites outside of its sphere of control, but it does not properly prevent the external site from modifying  security-critical properties of the window.opener object, such as the location property.","ExtendedDescription":"When a user clicks a link to an external site (\"target\"), the target=\"_blank\" attribute causes the target site's contents to be opened in a new window or tab, which runs in the same process as the original page. The window.opener object records information about the original page that offered the link. If an attacker can run script on the target page, then they could read or modify certain properties of the window.opener object, including the location property - even if the original and target site are not the same origin. An attacker can modify the location property to automatically redirect the user to a malicious site, e.g. as part of a phishing attack. Since this redirect happens in the original window/tab - which is not necessarily visible, since the browser is focusing the display on the new target page - the user might not notice any suspicious redirection.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Medium","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"266","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"JavaScript","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Web Based","Prevalence":"Often"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"tabnabbing"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"This weakness is introduced during the design of an application when the architect does not specify that a linked external document should not be able to alter the location of the calling page."},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"This weakness is introduced during the coding of an application when the developer does not include the noopener and/or noreferrer value for the rel attribute."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Alter Execution Logic"],"Note":"The user may be redirected to an untrusted page that contains undesired content or malicious script code."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
