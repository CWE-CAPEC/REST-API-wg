{"ID":"1260","Name":"Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Stable","Description":"The product allows address regions to overlap, which can result in the bypassing of intended memory protection.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nIsolated memory regions and access control (read/write) policies are used by hardware to protect privileged software. Software components are often allowed to change or remap memory region definitions in order to enable flexible and dynamically changeable memory management by system software.\n\n\nIf a software component running at lower privilege can program a memory address region to overlap with other memory regions used by software running at higher privilege, privilege escalation may be available to attackers. The memory protection unit (MPU) logic can incorrectly handle such an address overlap and allow the lower-privilege software to read or write into the protected memory region, resulting in privilege escalation attack. An address overlap weakness can also be used to launch a denial of service attack on the higher-privilege software memory regions.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"284","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"119","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"},{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Memory Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Processor Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"Such issues could be introduced during hardware architecture and design or implementation and identified later during the Testing phase."},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","Read Memory","DoS: Instability"],"Likelihood":["High"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Manual Analysis","Description":"Create a high privilege memory block of any arbitrary size.

In some MPU designs, the priority scheme can also be programmed by trusted software.\n\n\nHardware logic or trusted firmware can also check for region definitions and block programming of memory regions with overlapping addresses. \n\n\nThe memory-access-control-check filter can also be designed to apply a policy filter to all of the overlapping ranges, i.e., if an address is within Region_0 and Region_1, then access to this address is only granted if both Region_0 and Region_1 policies allow the access.\n","Effectiveness":"High"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"For example, consider a design with a 16-bit address that has two software privilege levels: Privileged_SW and Non_privileged_SW.
