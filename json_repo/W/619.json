{"ID":"619","Name":"Dangling Database Cursor ('Cursor Injection')","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"If a database cursor is not closed properly, then it could become accessible to other users while retaining the same privileges that were originally assigned, leaving the cursor \"dangling.\"","ExtendedDescription":"For example, an improper dangling cursor could arise from unhandled exceptions. The impact of the issue depends on the cursor's role, but SQL injection attacks are commonly possible.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"402","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary","Description":"This could be primary when the programmer never attempts to close the cursor when finished with it."},{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"SQL","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Database Server","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"BackgroundDetails":["A cursor is a feature in Oracle PL/SQL and other languages that provides a handle for executing and accessing the results of SQL queries."],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"This issue is currently reported for unhandled exceptions, but it is theoretically possible any time the programmer does not close the cursor at the proper time."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity"],"Impact":["Read Application Data","Modify Application Data"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Close cursors immediately after access to them is complete.
