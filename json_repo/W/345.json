The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were \"insecure by design\" [REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications."},{"BodyText":"Multiple vendors did not sign firmware images."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2022-30260","Description":"Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30260"},{"Reference":"CVE-2022-30267","Description":"Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30267"},{"Reference":"CVE-2022-30272","Description":"Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30272"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Insufficient Verification of Data"},{"TaxonomyName":"OWASP Top Ten 2004","EntryID":"A3","EntryName":"Broken Authentication and Session Management","MappingFit":"CWE More Specific"},{"TaxonomyName":"WASC","EntryID":"12","EntryName":"Content Spoofing"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["111","141","142","148","218","384","385","386","387","388","665","701"],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-44","Section":"\"Sin 15: Not Updating Easily.\" Page 231","Authors":["Michael Howard","David LeBlanc","John Viega"],"Title":"24 Deadly Sins of Software Security","Publication":"McGraw-Hill","PublicationYear":"2010"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1283","Authors":["Forescout Vedere Labs"],"Title":"OT:ICEFALL: The legacy of \"insecure by design\" and its implications for certifications and risk management","PublicationYear":"2022","PublicationMonth":"06","PublicationDay":"20","URL":"https://www.forescout.com/resources/ot-icefall-report/"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Discouraged","Rationale":"This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
