{"ID":"925","Name":"Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.","ExtendedDescription":"Certain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"940","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Mobile","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"Intent Spoofing"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Gain Privileges or Assume Identity"],"Note":"Another application can impersonate the operating system and cause the software to perform an unintended action."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
