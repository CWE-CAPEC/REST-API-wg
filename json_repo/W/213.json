Each stakeholder effectively has its own intended security policy that the product is expected to uphold. When a developer does not treat that information as sensitive, this can introduce a vulnerability that violates the expectations of the product's users.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"200","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Policy","Note":"This can occur when the product's policy does not account for all relevant stakeholders, or when the policies of other stakeholders are not interpreted properly."},{"Phase":"Requirements","Note":"This can occur when requirements do not explicitly account for all relevant stakeholders."},{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"Communications or data exchange frameworks may be chosen that exchange or provide access to more information than strictly needed."},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"This can occur when the developer does not properly track the flow of sensitive information and how it is exposed, e.g., via an API."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Application Data"]}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-130","Entries":[{"IntroText":"This code displays some information on a web page."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"JSP","ExampleCode":"```\n\tSocial Security Number: \u003c%= ssn %\u003e\u003c/br\u003eCredit Card Number: \u003c%= ccn %\u003e\n```"},{"BodyText":"The code displays a user's credit card and social security numbers, even though they aren't absolutely necessary."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2002-1725","Description":"Script calls phpinfo()","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1725"},{"Reference":"CVE-2004-0033","Description":"Script calls phpinfo()","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0033"},{"Reference":"CVE-2003-1181","Description":"Script calls phpinfo()","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1181"},{"Reference":"CVE-2004-1422","Description":"Script calls phpinfo()","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1422"},{"Reference":"CVE-2004-1590","Description":"Script calls phpinfo()","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1590"},{"Reference":"CVE-2003-1038","Description":"Product lists DLLs and full pathnames.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1038"},{"Reference":"CVE-2005-1205","Description":"Telnet protocol allows servers to obtain sensitive environment information from clients.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1205"},{"Reference":"CVE-2005-0488","Description":"Telnet protocol allows servers to obtain sensitive environment information from clients.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0488"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Intended information leak"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
