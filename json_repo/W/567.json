{"ID":"567","Name":"Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product does not properly synchronize shared data, such as static variables across threads, which can lead to undefined behavior and unpredictable data changes.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nWithin servlets, shared static variables are not protected from concurrent access, but servlets are multithreaded. This is a typical programming mistake in J2EE applications, since the multithreading is handled by the framework. When a shared variable can be influenced by an attacker, one thread could wind up modifying the variable to contain data that is not valid for a different thread that is also using the data within the variable.\n\n\nNote that this weakness is not unique to servlets.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"820","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1305","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"488","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability"],"Impact":["Read Application Data","Modify Application Data","DoS: Instability","DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"],"Note":"If the shared variable contains sensitive data, it may be manipulated or displayed in another user session.
