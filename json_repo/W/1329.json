{"ID":"1329","Name":"Reliance on Component That is Not Updateable","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product contains a component that cannot be updated or patched in order to remove vulnerabilities or significant bugs.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\n If the component is discovered to contain a vulnerability or critical bug, but the issue cannot be fixed using an update or patch, then the product's owner will not be able to protect against the issue. The only option might be replacement of the product, which could be too financially or operationally expensive for the product owner. As a result, the inability to patch or update can leave the product open to attacker exploitation or critical operation failures. This weakness can be especially difficult to manage when using ROM, firmware, or similar components that traditionally have had limited or no update capabilities. \n\n\n In industries such as healthcare, \"legacy\" devices can be operated for decades. As a US task force report [REF-1197] notes, \"the inability to update or replace equipment has both large and small health care delivery organizations struggle with numerous unsupported legacy systems that cannot easily be replaced (hardware, software, and operating systems) with large numbers of vulnerabilities and few modern countermeasures.\" \n\n\n While hardware can be prone to this weakness, software systems can also be affected, such as when a third-party driver or library is no longer actively maintained or supported but is still critical for the required functionality.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1357","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1357","ViewID":"1194","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"664","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"ICS/OT","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Requirements","Note":"Requirements development might not consider the importance of updates over the lifetime of the product or might intentionally exclude this capability due to concerns such as expense or speed to market."},{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"Lack of planning during architecture development and design, or external pressures such as speed to market, could ignore the capability to update."},{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"Designers might omit capabilities for updating a component due to time pressures to release the product or assumptions about the stability of the component."},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"The weakness can appear through oversight during implementation."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Access Control","Authentication","Authorization","Other"],"Impact":["Gain Privileges or Assume Identity","Bypass Protection Mechanism","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands","DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart","Quality Degradation","Reduce Maintainability"],"Note":"If an attacker can identify an exploitable vulnerability in one product that has no means of patching, the attack may be used against all affected versions of that product."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Architecture or Design Review","Description":"Check the consumer or maintainer documentation, the architecture/design documentation, or the original requirements to ensure that the documentation includes details for how to update the firmware.","Effectiveness":"Moderate"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Requirements"],"Description":"Specify requirements that each component should be updateable, including ROM, firmware, etc."},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Design the product to allow for updating of its components.
