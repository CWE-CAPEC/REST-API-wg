The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.\n\n\nIf errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.\n\n\nAvoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.\n"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-38","Entries":[{"IntroText":"The following code checks validity of the supplied username and password and notifies the user of a successful or failed login."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Perl","ExampleCode":"```\n\tmy $username=param('username'); \n\tmy $password=param('password'); \n\tif (IsValidUsername($username) == 1) \n\t{ \n\t\tif (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1) \n\t\t{ \n\t\t\tprint \"Login Successful\"; \n\t\t} \n\t\telse \n\t\t{ \n\t\t\tprint \"Login Failed - incorrect password\"; \n\t\t} \n\t} \n\telse \n\t{ \n\t\tprint \"Login Failed - unknown username\"; \n\t} \n```"},{"BodyText":"In the above code, there are different messages for when an incorrect username is supplied, versus when the username is correct but the password is wrong.
