If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations."},{"MitigationID":"MIT-49","Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Strategy":"Separation of Privilege","Description":"Consider following the principle of separation of privilege.
