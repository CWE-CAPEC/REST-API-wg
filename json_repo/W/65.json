{"ID":"65","Name":"Windows Hard Link","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently handle when the name is associated with a hard link to a target that is outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.","ExtendedDescription":"Failure for a system to check for hard links can result in vulnerability to different types of attacks. For example, an attacker can escalate their privileges if a file used by a privileged program is replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g. AUTOEXEC.BAT). When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, or prevent the program from accurately processing data.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"59","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Windows","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity"],"Impact":["Read Files or Directories","Modify Files or Directories"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"MitigationID":"MIT-48.1","Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Strategy":"Separation of Privilege","Description":"\n\nFollow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system.\n\n\nDenying access to a file can prevent an attacker from replacing that file with a link to a sensitive file.
