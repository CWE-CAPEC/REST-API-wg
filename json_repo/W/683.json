{"ID":"683","Name":"Function Call With Incorrect Order of Arguments","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies the arguments in an incorrect order, leading to resultant weaknesses.","ExtendedDescription":"While this weakness might be caught by the compiler in some languages, it can occur more frequently in cases in which the called function accepts variable numbers or types of arguments, such as format strings in C. It also can occur in languages or environments that do not enforce strong typing.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"628","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"This problem typically occurs when the programmer makes a typo, or copy and paste errors."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Quality Degradation"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Use the function, procedure, or routine as specified."},{"Phase":["Testing"],"Description":"Because this function call often produces incorrect behavior it will usually be detected during testing or normal operation of the product. During testing exercise all possible control paths will typically expose this weakness except in rare cases when the incorrect function call accidentally produces the correct results or if the provided argument type is very similar to the expected argument type."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-62","Entries":[{"IntroText":"The following PHP method authenticates a user given a username/password combination but is called with the parameters in reverse order."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"PHP","ExampleCode":"```\n\tfunction authenticate($username, $password) {\n```\n// authenticate user* \n\t\t\t...}\n\t\n\tauthenticate($_POST['password'], $_POST['username']);"}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2006-7049","Description":"Application calls functions with arguments in the wrong order, allowing attacker to bypass intended access restrictions.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-7049"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
