{"ID":"551","Name":"Incorrect Behavior Order: Authorization Before Parsing and Canonicalization","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"If a web server does not fully parse requested URLs before it examines them for authorization, it may be possible for an attacker to bypass authorization protection.","ExtendedDescription":"For instance, the character strings /./ and / both mean current directory. If /SomeDirectory is a protected directory and an attacker requests /./SomeDirectory, the attacker may be able to gain access to the resource if /./ is not converted to / before the authorization check is performed.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"863","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"696","ViewID":"1000"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Access Control"],"Impact":["Bypass Protection Mechanism"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"URL Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated and processed for authorization.
