Moreover, a complete HMAC will contain an iterate hash function that breaks up a message into blocks of a fixed size and iterates over them with a compression function (e.g., SHA-256). Therefore, the implementation of the HMAC in OpenPiton SoC is incomplete. Such HMAC engines will not be used in real-world applications as the messages will usually be longer than 512 bits. For instance, OpenTitan offers a comprehensive HMAC implementation that utilizes a FIFO for temporarily storing the truncated message, as detailed in [REF-1359]."},{"BodyText":"To mitigate this, implement the iterative function to break up a message into blocks of a fixed size."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2001-1585","Description":"Missing challenge-response step allows authentication bypass using public key.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1585"}],"FunctionalAreas":["Cryptography"],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Missing Required Cryptographic Step"},{"TaxonomyName":"OWASP Top Ten 2007","EntryID":"A8","EntryName":"Insecure Cryptographic Storage","MappingFit":"CWE More Specific"},{"TaxonomyName":"OWASP Top Ten 2007","EntryID":"A9","EntryName":"Insecure Communications","MappingFit":"CWE More Specific"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["68"],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1358","Title":"hmac_wrapper.sv","PublicationYear":"2021","URL":"https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac21/blob/main/piton/design/chip/tile/ariane/src/hmac/hmac_wrapper.sv#L41","URLDate":"2023-07-15"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1359","Title":"HMAC HWIP Technical Specification","PublicationYear":"2023","URL":"https://opentitan.org/book/hw/ip/hmac/","URLDate":"2023-10-05"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
