{"ID":"1299","Name":"Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The lack of protections on alternate paths to access\n                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers\n                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an\n                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are\n\t\tonly performed against the primary path.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nAn asset inside a chip might have access-control protections through one interface. However, if all paths to the asset are not protected, an attacker might compromise the asset through alternate paths. These alternate paths could be through shadow or mirror registers inside the IP core, or could be paths from other external-facing interfaces to the IP core or SoC.\n\n\nConsider an SoC with various interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented for SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then an attacker could still modify the SoC internal registers through alternate paths by coming through interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc. \n\n\nAlternatively, attackers might be able to bypass existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow registers. Shadow registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch. If the shadow registers are not access-protected, attackers could simply initiate transactions to the shadow registers and compromise system security. \n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"PeerOf","CweID":"1191","ViewID":"1194","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"420","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"288","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Microcontroller Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Processor Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Bus/Interface Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability","Access Control"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","Read Memory","DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands","Gain Privileges or Assume Identity","Alter Execution Logic","Bypass Protection Mechanism","Quality Degradation"],"Likelihood":["High"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Requirements"],"Description":"Protect assets from accesses against all potential interfaces and alternate paths.","Effectiveness":"Defense in Depth"},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Protect assets from accesses against all potential interfaces and alternate paths.","Effectiveness":"Defense in Depth"},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Protect assets from accesses against all potential interfaces and alternate paths.","Effectiveness":"Defense in Depth"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-176","Entries":[{"IntroText":"Register SECURE_ME is located at address 0xF00.
