Other than debugger authentication (e.g., using passwords or challenges), the authorization can also be based on the system state or boot stage. For example, full system debug access might only be allowed early in boot after a system reset to ensure that previous session data is not accessible to the authenticated debugger.\n\n\nIf this protection mechanism does not ensure that internal assets have the correct debug access level during each boot stage or change in system state, an attacker could obtain sensitive information from the internal asset using a debugger.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"863","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"System on Chip","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Memory"]},{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Modify Memory"]},{"Scope":["Authorization","Access Control"],"Impact":["Gain Privileges or Assume Identity","Bypass Protection Mechanism"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Manual Analysis","Description":"Check 2 devices for their passcode to authenticate access to JTAG/debugging ports.

Thus, the processor enters debug mode only when the privilege level requirement is met, and the correct debug password is provided."},{"BodyText":"The following code [REF-1377] illustrates an instance of a vulnerable implementation of debug mode.
