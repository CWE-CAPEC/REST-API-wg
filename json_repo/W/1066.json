If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n\n\nAs examples, the serializable nature of a data element comes from a serializable SerializableAttribute attribute in .NET and the inheritance from the java.io.Serializable interface in Java.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"710","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Reliability"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCRM","EntryID":"ASCRM-RLB-2"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-961","Section":"ASCRM-RLB-2","Authors":["Object Management Group (OMG)"],"Title":"Automated Source Code Reliability Measure (ASCRM)","PublicationYear":"2016","PublicationMonth":"01","URL":"http://www.omg.org/spec/ASCRM/1.0/"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.","Comments":"Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.","Reasons":["Other"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Content Team","SubmissionOrganization":"MITRE","SubmissionDate":"2018-07-02","SubmissionComment":"Entry derived from Common Quality Enumeration (CQE) Draft 0.9.","SubmissionVersion":"3.2","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2019-01-03"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated Description"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-08-20","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-01-31","ModificationComment":"updated Description"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2024-02-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes","ModificationVersion":"4.14","ModificationReleaseDate":"2024-02-29"}]}
