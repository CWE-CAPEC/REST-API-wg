When they find a string of the right length, the computation will take a bit longer, because the for loop will run at least once. Additionally, with this code, the attacker can possibly learn one character of the password at a time, because when they guess the first character right, the computation will take longer than a wrong guesses. Such an attack can break even the most sophisticated password with a few hundred guesses."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Python","ExampleCode":"```\n\tdef validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw): \n\t\t\tif len(actual_pw) \u003c\u003e len(typed_pw): \n\t\t\t\treturn 0\n\t\t\tfor i in len(actual_pw): \n\t\t\t\tif actual_pw[i] \u003c\u003e typed_pw[i]: \n\t\t\t\t\treturn 0\n\t\t\treturn 1\n```"},{"BodyText":"Note that in this example, the actual password must be handled in constant time as far as the attacker is concerned, even if the actual password is of an unusual length.
