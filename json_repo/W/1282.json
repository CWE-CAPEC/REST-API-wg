Storing these assets in read-only memory (ROM), fuses, or one-time programmable (OTP) memory provides strong integrity guarantees and provides a root of trust for securing the rest of the system. Security is lost if assets assumed to be immutable can be modified.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"668","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"471","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"Keys, code, configuration settings, and other data should be programmed in write-once or read-only memory instead of writable memory."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Varies by Context"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"All immutable code or data should be programmed into ROM or write-once memory."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"Cryptographic hash functions are commonly used to create unique fixed-length digests used to ensure the integrity of code and keys. A golden digest is stored on the device and compared to the digest computed from the data to be verified. If the digests match, the data has not been maliciously modified. If an attacker can modify the golden digest they then have the ability to store arbitrary data that passes the verification check. Hash digests used to verify public keys and early stage boot code should be immutable, with the strongest protection offered by hardware immutability."}]}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["458","679"],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
