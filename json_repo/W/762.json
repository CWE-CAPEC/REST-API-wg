{"ID":"762","Name":"Mismatched Memory Management Routines","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product attempts to return a memory resource to the system, but it calls a release function that is not compatible with the function that was originally used to allocate that resource.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis weakness can be generally described as mismatching memory management routines, such as:\n\n\n  - The memory was allocated on the stack (automatically), but it was deallocated using the memory management routine free() (CWE-590), which is intended for explicitly allocated heap memory.\n\n  - The memory was allocated explicitly using one set of memory management functions, and deallocated using a different set. For example, memory might be allocated with malloc() in C++ instead of the new operator, and then deallocated with the delete operator.\n\nWhen the memory management functions are mismatched, the consequences may be as severe as code execution, memory corruption, or program crash. Consequences and ease of exploit will vary depending on the implementation of the routines and the object being managed.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Low","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"763","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"404","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"},{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Memory-Unsafe","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Availability","Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation","Description":"Use a tool that dynamically detects memory management problems, such as valgrind."},{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-15","Method":"Automated Dynamic Analysis","Description":"Use tools that are integrated during compilation to insert runtime error-checking mechanisms related to memory safety errors, such as AddressSanitizer (ASan) for C/C++ [REF-1518].","Effectiveness":"Moderate","EffectivenessNotes":"Crafted inputs are necessary to reach the code containing the error, such as generated by fuzzers.
