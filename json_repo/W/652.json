{"ID":"652","Name":"Improper Neutralization of Data within XQuery Expressions ('XQuery Injection')","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product uses external input to dynamically construct an XQuery expression used to retrieve data from an XML database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes that input. This allows an attacker to control the structure of the query.","ExtendedDescription":"The net effect is that the attacker will have control over the information selected from the XML database and may use that ability to control application flow, modify logic, retrieve unauthorized data, or bypass important checks (e.g. authentication).","LikelihoodOfExploit":"High","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"943","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"91","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Application Data"],"Note":"An attacker might be able to read sensitive information from the XML database."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Use parameterized queries.
