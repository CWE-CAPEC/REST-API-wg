{"ID":"581","Name":"Object Model Violation: Just One of Equals and Hashcode Defined","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product does not maintain equal hashcodes for equal objects.","ExtendedDescription":"Java objects are expected to obey a number of invariants related to equality. One of these invariants is that equal objects must have equal hashcodes. In other words, if a.equals(b) == true then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode().","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"573","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"697","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Other"],"Impact":["Other"],"Note":"If this invariant is not upheld, it is likely to cause trouble if objects of this class are stored in a collection. If the objects of the class in question are used as a key in a Hashtable or if they are inserted into a Map or Set, it is critical that equal objects have equal hashcodes."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
