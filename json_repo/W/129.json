Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \"rebasing\" (for Windows) and \"prelinking\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking. \n\n\n For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335]. \n","Effectiveness":"Defense in Depth","EffectivenessNotes":"These techniques do not provide a complete solution.

Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications.

As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\n\nWhen accessing a user-controlled array index, use a stringent range of values that are within the target array. Make sure that you do not allow negative values to be used. That is, verify the minimum as well as the maximum of the range of acceptable values.\n"},{"MitigationID":"MIT-35","Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Be especially careful to validate all input when invoking code that crosses language boundaries, such as from an interpreted language to native code.

In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.\n\n\nThis may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.\n\n\nBe careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.\n","Effectiveness":"Limited","EffectivenessNotes":"The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"In the code snippet below, an untrusted integer value is used to reference an object in an array."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Java","ExampleCode":"```\n\tpublic String getValue(int index) {\n\t\treturn array[index];\n\t}\n```"},{"BodyText":"If index is outside of the range of the array, this may result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception being raised."}]},{"ID":"DX-34","Entries":[{"IntroText":"The following example takes a user-supplied value to allocate an array of objects and then operates on the array."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Java","ExampleCode":"```\n\tprivate void buildList ( int untrustedListSize ){\n\t\tif ( 0 \u003e untrustedListSize ){\n\t\t\tdie(\"Negative value supplied for list size, die evil hacker!\");\n\t\t}\n\t\tWidget[] list = new Widget [ untrustedListSize ];\n\t\tlist[0] = new Widget();\n\t}\n```"},{"BodyText":"This example attempts to build a list from a user-specified value, and even checks to ensure a non-negative value is supplied.
