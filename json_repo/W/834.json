In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"691","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"},{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)","DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory)","DoS: Amplification","DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"],"Note":"Excessive looping will cause unexpected consumption of resources, such as CPU cycles or memory.
