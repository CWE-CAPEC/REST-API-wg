{"ID":"354","Name":"Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product does not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values or \"checksums\" of a message. This may prevent it from detecting if the data has been modified or corrupted in transmission.","ExtendedDescription":"Improper validation of checksums before use results in an unnecessary risk that can easily be mitigated. The protocol specification describes the algorithm used for calculating the checksum. It is then a simple matter of implementing the calculation and verifying that the calculated checksum and the received checksum match. Improper verification of the calculated checksum and the received checksum can lead to far greater consequences.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Medium","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"345","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"345","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"754","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"PeerOf","CweID":"353","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Other"],"Impact":["Modify Application Data","Other"],"Note":"Integrity checks usually use a secret key that helps authenticate the data origin.
