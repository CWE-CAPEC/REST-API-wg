{"ID":"1266","Name":"Improper Scrubbing of Sensitive Data from Decommissioned Device","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product does not properly provide a capability for the product administrator to remove sensitive data at the time the product is decommissioned.  A scrubbing capability could be missing, insufficient, or incorrect.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nWhen a product is decommissioned - i.e., taken out of service - best practices or regulatory requirements may require the administrator to remove or overwrite sensitive data first, i.e. \"scrubbing.\" Improper scrubbing of sensitive data from a decommissioned device leaves that data vulnerable to acquisition by a malicious actor. Sensitive data may include, but is not limited to, device/manufacturer proprietary information, user/device credentials, network configurations, and other forms of sensitive data.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"404","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Policy"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Memory"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"\n\nFunctionality to completely scrub data from a product at the conclusion of its lifecycle should be part of the design phase.

This information may be conveyed, for example, in an Administrators Guide or a Statement of Volatility.\n"},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"\n\nIf the capability to wipe sensitive data isn't built-in, the manufacturer may need to provide a utility to scrub sensitive data from storage if that data is located in a place which is non-accessible by the administrator. One example of this could be when sensitive data is stored on an EEPROM for which there is no user/admin interface provided by the system.\n"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["150","37","545","546","675"],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1080","Authors":["Christopher Tarnovsky"],"Title":"Security Failures in Secure Devices","URL":"https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-08/Tarnovsky/Presentation/bh-eu-08-tarnovsky.pdf"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
