{"ID":"1057","Name":"Data Access Operations Outside of Expected Data Manager Component","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product uses a dedicated, central data manager component as required by design, but it contains code that performs data-access operations that do not use this data manager.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis issue can make the product perform more slowly than intended, since the intended central data manager may have been explicitly optimized for performance or other quality characteristics.
