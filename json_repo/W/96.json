Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n"},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Strategy":"Output Encoding","Description":"Perform proper output validation and escaping to neutralize all code syntax from data written to code files."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-32","Entries":[{"IntroText":"This example attempts to write user messages to a message file and allow users to view them."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"PHP","ExampleCode":"```\n\t$MessageFile = \"messages.out\";\n\tif ($_GET[\"action\"] == \"NewMessage\") {\n\t\t$name = $_GET[\"name\"];\n\t\t$message = $_GET[\"message\"];\n\t\t$handle = fopen($MessageFile, \"a+\");\n\t\tfwrite($handle, \"\u003cb\u003e$name\u003c/b\u003e says '$message'\u003chr\u003e\\n\");\n\t\tfclose($handle);\n\t\techo \"Message Saved!\u003cp\u003e\\n\";\n\t}\n\telse if ($_GET[\"action\"] == \"ViewMessages\") {\n\t\tinclude($MessageFile);\n\t}\n```"},{"BodyText":"While the programmer intends for the MessageFile to only include data, an attacker can provide a message such as:"},{"Nature":"Attack","ExampleCode":"```\n\tname=h4x0r\n\tmessage=%3C?php%20system(%22/bin/ls%20-l%22);?%3E\n```"},{"BodyText":"which will decode to the following:"},{"Nature":"Attack","ExampleCode":"```\n\t\u003c?php system(\"/bin/ls -l\");?\u003e\n```"},{"BodyText":"The programmer thought they were just including the contents of a regular data file, but PHP parsed it and executed the code.
