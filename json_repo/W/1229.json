Resource allocation and management is expected to be performed explicitly by the associated code. However, in systems with complex behavior, the product might indirectly produce new kinds of resources that were never intended in the original design. For example, a covert channel is a resource that was never explicitly intended by the developer, but it is useful to attackers. \"Parasitic computing,\" while not necessarily malicious in nature, effectively tricks a product into performing unintended computations on behalf of another party.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"664","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Varies by Context"]}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-193","Entries":[{"IntroText":"In this example, the attacker observes how long an authentication takes when the user types in the correct password."},{"BodyText":"When the attacker tries their own values, they can first try strings of various length. When they find a string of the right length, the computation will take a bit longer, because the for loop will run at least once. Additionally, with this code, the attacker can possibly learn one character of the password at a time, because when they guess the first character right, the computation will take longer than a wrong guesses.
