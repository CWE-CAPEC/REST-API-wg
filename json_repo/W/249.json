{"ID":"249","Name":"DEPRECATED: Often Misused: Path Manipulation","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Deprecated","Description":"This entry has been deprecated because of name\n\tconfusion and an accidental combination of multiple\n\tweaknesses. Most of its content has been transferred to\n\tCWE-785.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis entry was deprecated for several reasons. The primary reason is over-loading of the \"path manipulation\" term and the description. The original description for this entry was the same as that for the \"Often Misused: File System\" item in the original Seven Pernicious Kingdoms paper. However, Seven Pernicious Kingdoms also has a \"Path Manipulation\" phrase that is for external control of pathnames (CWE-73), which is a factor in symbolic link following and path traversal, neither of which is explicitly mentioned in 7PK. Fortify uses the phrase \"Often Misused: Path Manipulation\" for a broader range of problems, generally for issues related to buffer management. Given the multiple conflicting uses of this term, there is a chance that CWE users may have incorrectly mapped to this entry.\n\n\nThe second reason for deprecation is an implied combination of multiple weaknesses within buffer-handling functions. The focus of this entry was generally on the path-conversion functions and their association with buffer overflows. However, some of Fortify's Vulncat entries have the term \"path manipulation\" but describe a non-overflow weakness in which the buffer is not guaranteed to contain the entire pathname, i.e., there is information truncation (see CWE-222 for a similar concept). A new entry for this non-overflow weakness may be created in a future version of CWE.\n","MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This CWE has been deprecated.","Comments":"See description for suggestions for other CWE IDs to use.","Reasons":["Deprecated"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"7 Pernicious Kingdoms","SubmissionDate":"2006-07-19","SubmissionVersion":"Draft 3","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2006-07-19"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"Eric Dalci","ModificationOrganization":"Cigital","ModificationDate":"2008-07-01","ModificationComment":"updated Time_of_Introduction"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationOrganization":"KDM Analytics","ModificationDate":"2008-08-01","ModificationComment":"added/updated white box definitions"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-09-08","ModificationComment":"updated Applicable_Platforms, Relationships, Other_Notes, Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2009-05-27","ModificationComment":"updated Demonstrative_Examples"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"KDM Analytics","ModificationDate":"2009-07-17","ModificationComment":"Described inconsistencies in this entry, which the CWE Content Team had already slated for deprecation."},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2009-07-27","ModificationComment":"updated Affected_Resources, Applicable_Platforms, Demonstrative_Examples, Description, Maintenance_Notes, Name, Other_Notes, Potential_Mitigations, Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings, Time_of_Introduction, Type, White_Box_Definitions"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2009-10-29","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2021-03-15","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Maintenance_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2022-10-13","ModificationComment":"updated Description"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Often Misused: Path Manipulation","Date":"2009-07-27"}]}
