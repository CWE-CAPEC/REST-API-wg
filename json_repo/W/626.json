{"ID":"626","Name":"Null Byte Interaction Error (Poison Null Byte)","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product does not properly handle null bytes or NUL characters when passing data between different representations or components.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nA null byte (NUL character) can have different meanings across representations or languages. For example, it is a string terminator in standard C libraries, but Perl and PHP strings do not treat it as a terminator. When two representations are crossed - such as when Perl or PHP invokes underlying C functionality - this can produce an interaction error with unexpected results. Similar issues have been reported for ASP. Other interpreters written in C might also be affected.\n\n\nThe poison null byte is frequently useful in path traversal attacks by terminating hard-coded extensions that are added to a filename. It can play a role in regular expression processing in PHP.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"147","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"436","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"PHP","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"Perl","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"ASP.NET","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Unexpected State"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
