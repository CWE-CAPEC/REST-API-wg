{"ID":"548","Name":"Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"A directory listing is inappropriately exposed, yielding potentially sensitive information to attackers.","ExtendedDescription":"A directory listing provides an attacker with the complete index of all the resources located inside of the directory. The specific risks and consequences vary depending on which files are listed and accessible.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"497","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Files or Directories"],"Note":"Exposing the contents of a directory can lead to an attacker gaining access to source code or providing useful information for the attacker to devise exploits, such as creation times of files or any information that may be encoded in file names. The directory listing may also compromise private or confidential data."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)","Effectiveness":"High"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design","System Configuration"],"Description":"Recommendations include restricting access to important directories or files by adopting a need to know requirement for both the document and server root, and turning off features such as Automatic Directory Listings that could expose private files and provide information that could be utilized by an attacker when formulating or conducting an attack."}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OWASP Top Ten 2004","EntryID":"A10","EntryName":"Insecure Configuration Management","MappingFit":"CWE More Specific"},{"TaxonomyName":"WASC","EntryID":"16","EntryName":"Directory Indexing"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
