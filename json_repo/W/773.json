For example, when managing system resources in POSIX, setrlimit() can be used to set limits for certain types of resources, and getrlimit() can determine how many resources are available. However, these functions are not available on all operating systems.\n\n\nWhen the current levels get close to the maximum that is defined for the application (see CWE-770), then limit the allocation of further resources to privileged users; alternately, begin releasing resources for less-privileged users. While this mitigation may protect the system from attack, it will not necessarily stop attackers from adversely impacting other users.\n\n\nEnsure that the application performs the appropriate error checks and error handling in case resources become unavailable (CWE-703).\n"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"FIO42-C","EntryName":"Close files when they are no longer needed","MappingFit":"CWE More Abstract"},{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP14","EntryName":"Failure to Release Resource"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
