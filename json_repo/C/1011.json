{"ID":"1011","Name":"Authorize Actors","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of a system's authorization components. Frequently these deal with enforcing that agents have the required permissions before performing certain operations, such as modifying data. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of quality of the authorization capability if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"114","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"15","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"219","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"220","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"266","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"267","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"268","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"269","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"270","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"271","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"272","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"273","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"274","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"276","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"277","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"279","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"280","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"281","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"282","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"283","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"284","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"285","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"286","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"300","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"341","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"359","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"403","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"419","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"420","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"425","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"426","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"434","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"527","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"528","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"529","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"530","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"538","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"551","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"552","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"566","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"639","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"642","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"647","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"653","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"656","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"668","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"669","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"671","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"673","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"708","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"732","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"770","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"782","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"827","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"862","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"863","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"921","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"923","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"939","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"942","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
