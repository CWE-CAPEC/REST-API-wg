{"ID":"1020","Name":"Verify Message Integrity","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of a system's data integrity components. Frequently these deal with ensuring integrity of data, such as messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of data integrity quality if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"353","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"354","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"390","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"391","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"494","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"565","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"649","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"707","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"755","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"924","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See member weaknesses of this category.","Reasons":["Category"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"Joanna C.S.
