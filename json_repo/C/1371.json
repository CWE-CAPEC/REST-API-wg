Therefore possibly opening up the attack surface and vulnerabilities.\" Note: members of this category include \"Nearest IT Neighbor\" recommendations from the report, as well as suggestions by the CWE team. These relationships are likely to change in future CWE versions.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"489","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"912","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"1059","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"1242","ViewID":"1358"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1248"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
