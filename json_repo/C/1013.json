{"ID":"1013","Name":"Encrypt Data","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of data confidentiality in a system. Frequently these deal with the use of encryption libraries. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality data encryption if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"256","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"257","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"260","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"261","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"311","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"312","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"313","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"314","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"315","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"316","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"317","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"318","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"319","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"321","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"323","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"324","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"325","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"326","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"327","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"328","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"330","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"331","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"332","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"333","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"334","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"335","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"336","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"337","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"338","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"339","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"347","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"522","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"523","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"757","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"759","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"760","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"780","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"922","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
