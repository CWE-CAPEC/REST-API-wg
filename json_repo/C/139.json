{"ID":"139","Name":"DEPRECATED: General Special Element Problems","Status":"Deprecated","Summary":"This entry has been deprecated. It is a leftover from PLOVER, but CWE-138 is a more appropriate mapping.","MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This CWE has been deprecated. It is also a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing.
