{"ID":"1015","Name":"Limit Access","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of system resources. Frequently these deal with restricting the amount of resources that are accessed by actors, such as memory, network connections, CPU or access points. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality of authentication if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"201","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"209","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"212","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"243","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"250","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"610","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"611","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"73","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See member weaknesses of this category.","Reasons":["Category"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"Joanna C.S.
