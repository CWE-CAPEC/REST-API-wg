{"ID":"1381","Name":"ICS Operations (\u0026 Maintenance): Exploitable Standard Operational Procedures","Status":"Incomplete","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the \"Exploitable Standard Operational Procedures\" category from the SEI ETF \"Categories of Security Vulnerabilities in ICS\" as published in March 2022: \"Standard ICS Operational Procedures developed for safety and operational functionality in a closed, controlled communications environment can introduce vulnerabilities in a more connected environment.\" Note: members of this category include \"Nearest IT Neighbor\" recommendations from the report, as well as suggestions by the CWE team. These relationships are likely to change in future CWE versions.","References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1248"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See member weaknesses of this category.","Reasons":["Category"]},"Notes":[{"Type":"Relationship","Note":"Relationships in this category are not authoritative and subject to change.

After the release of CWE 4.9 in October 2022, this has been under active review by members of the \"Boosting CWE\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG). Subgroup members did not find any CWEs to add to this category in CWE 4.11. There may be some gaps with respect to CWE's current scope, which will require consultation with many CWE stakeholders to resolve."}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"New Categories of Security Vulnerabilities (NCSV) Technical Project Team (TPT)","SubmissionOrganization":"Securing Energy Infrastructure Executive Task Force","SubmissionDate":"2022-03-09","SubmissionVersion":"4.7","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2022-04-28"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-01-31","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Maintenance_Notes, Relationship_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated Maintenance_Notes, Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"}]}
