{"ID":"1376","Name":"ICS Engineering (Construction/Deployment): Security Gaps in Commissioning","Status":"Incomplete","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the \"Security Gaps in Commissioning\" category from the SEI ETF \"Categories of Security Vulnerabilities in ICS\" as published in March 2022: \"As a large system is brought online components of the system may remain vulnerable until the entire system is operating and functional and security controls are put in place. This creates a window of opportunity for an adversary during the commissioning process.\" Note: members of this category include \"Nearest IT Neighbor\" recommendations from the report, as well as suggestions by the CWE team. These relationships are likely to change in future CWE versions.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"276","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"362","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"1393","ViewID":"1358"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1248"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing.
