{"ID":"1017","Name":"Lock Computer","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of a system's lockout mechanism. Frequently these deal with scenarios that take effect in case of multiple failed attempts to access a given resource. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of access to system assets if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"645","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See member weaknesses of this category.","Reasons":["Category"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"Joanna C.S.
