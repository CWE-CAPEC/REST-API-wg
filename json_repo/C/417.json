{"ID":"417","Name":"Communication Channel Errors","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to improper handling of communication channels and access paths. These weaknesses include problems in creating, managing, or removing alternate channels and alternate paths. Some of these can overlap virtual file problems and are commonly used in \"bypass\" attacks, such as those that exploit authentication errors.","TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryID":"CHAP.VIRTFILE","EntryName":"Channel and Path Errors"}],"Relationships":[{"CweID":"322","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"346","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"385","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"419","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"420","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"425","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"515","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"918","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"924","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"940","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"941","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1327","ViewID":"699"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See member weaknesses of this category.","Reasons":["Category"]},"Notes":[{"Type":"Research Gap","Note":"Most of these issues are probably under-studied.
