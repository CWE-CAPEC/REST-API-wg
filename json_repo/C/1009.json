{"ID":"1009","Name":"Audit","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of audit-based components of the system. Frequently these deal with logging user activities in order to identify attackers and modifications to the system. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality of the audit capability if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"117","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"223","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"224","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"532","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"778","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"779","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See member weaknesses of this category.","Reasons":["Category"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"Joanna C.S.
