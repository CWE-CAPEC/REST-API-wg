For example, information exposure can impact the Limit Access and Limit Exposure security tactics. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality of many capabilities if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"208","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"392","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"460","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"544","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"602","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"703","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"754","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"784","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"807","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
