{"ID":"1374","Name":"ICS Engineering (Construction/Deployment): Maker Breaker Blindness","Status":"Incomplete","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the \"Maker Breaker Blindness\" category from the SEI ETF \"Categories of Security Vulnerabilities in ICS\" as published in March 2022: \"Lack of awareness of deliberate attack techniques by people (vs failure modes from natural causes like weather or metal fatigue) may lead to insufficient security controls being built into ICS systems.\" Note: members of this category include \"Nearest IT Neighbor\" recommendations from the report, as well as suggestions by the CWE team. These relationships are likely to change in future CWE versions.","References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1248"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See member weaknesses of this category.","Reasons":["Category"]},"Notes":[{"Type":"Relationship","Note":"Relationships in this category are not authoritative and subject to change.
