{"ID":"1019","Name":"Validate Inputs","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of a system's input validation components. Frequently these deal with sanitizing, neutralizing and validating any externally provided inputs to minimize malformed data from entering the system and preventing code injection in the input data. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality of data flow in a system if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"138","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"150","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"20","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"349","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"352","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"472","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"473","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"502","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"59","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"601","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"641","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"643","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"652","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"74","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"75","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"76","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"77","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"78","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"79","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"790","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"791","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"792","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"793","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"794","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"795","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"796","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"797","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"88","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"89","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"90","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"91","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"93","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"94","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"943","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"95","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"96","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"97","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"98","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"99","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
