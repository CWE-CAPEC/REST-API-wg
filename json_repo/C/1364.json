{"ID":"1364","Name":"ICS Communications: Zone Boundary Failures","Status":"Incomplete","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the \"Zone Boundary Failures\" category from the SEI ETF \"Categories of Security Vulnerabilities in ICS\" as published in March 2022: \"Within an ICS system, for traffic that crosses through network zone boundaries, vulnerabilities arise when those boundaries were designed for safety or other purposes but are being repurposed for security.\" Note: members of this category include \"Nearest IT Neighbor\" recommendations from the report, as well as suggestions by the CWE team. These relationships are likely to change in future CWE versions.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"212","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"268","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"269","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"287","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"288","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"306","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"362","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"384","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"434","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"494","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"501","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"668","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"669","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"754","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"829","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"1189","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"1263","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"1303","ViewID":"1358"},{"CweID":"1393","ViewID":"1358"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1248"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
