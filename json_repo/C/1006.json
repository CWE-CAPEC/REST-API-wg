{"ID":"1006","Name":"Bad Coding Practices","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to coding practices that are deemed unsafe and increase the chances that an exploitable vulnerability will be present in the application. These weaknesses do not directly introduce a vulnerability, but indicate that the product has not been carefully developed or maintained. If a program is complex, difficult to maintain, not portable, or shows evidence of neglect, then there is a higher likelihood that weaknesses are buried in the code.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"358","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"360","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"478","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"487","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"489","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"547","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"561","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"562","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"563","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"581","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"586","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"605","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"628","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"654","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"656","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"694","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"807","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1041","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1043","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1044","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1045","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1046","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1048","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1049","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1050","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1063","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1065","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1066","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1067","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1070","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1071","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1072","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1073","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1079","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1082","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1084","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1085","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1087","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1089","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1092","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1094","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1097","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1098","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1099","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1101","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1102","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1103","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1104","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1106","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1107","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1108","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1109","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1113","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1114","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1115","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1116","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1117","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1126","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1127","ViewID":"699"},{"CweID":"1235","ViewID":"699"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
