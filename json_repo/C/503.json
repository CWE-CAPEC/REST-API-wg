{"ID":"503","Name":"DEPRECATED: Byte/Object Code","Status":"Deprecated","Summary":"This category has been deprecated. It was originally used for organizing the Development View (CWE-699), but it introduced unnecessary complexity and depth to the resulting tree.","MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This CWE has been deprecated. It is also a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See the summary, which might have suggestions for other CWEs to consider.","Reasons":["Category","Deprecated"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"Landwehr","SubmissionDate":"2006-07-19","SubmissionVersion":"Draft 3","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2006-07-19"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-09-08","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-01-19","ModificationComment":"updated Maintenance_Notes, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-11-08","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Maintenance_Notes, Name, Type"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2021-03-15","ModificationComment":"updated Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Byte/Object Code","Date":"2017-11-08"}]}
