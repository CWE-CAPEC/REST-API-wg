{"ID":"1018","Name":"Manage User Sessions","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of session management. Frequently these deal with the information or status about each user and their access rights for the duration of multiple requests. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality of session management if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"384","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"488","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"579","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"6","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"613","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"841","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
