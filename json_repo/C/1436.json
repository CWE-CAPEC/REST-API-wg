The CWE Program will work with OWASP to improve these mappings, possibly requiring modifications to CWE itself."}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Content Team","SubmissionOrganization":"MITRE","SubmissionDate":"2025-12-01","SubmissionVersion":"4.19","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2025-12-11"}]}
