{"ID":"1016","Name":"Limit Exposure","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of the entry points to a system. Frequently these deal with minimizing the attack surface through designing the system with the least needed amount of entry points. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of a system's defenses if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CweID":"210","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"211","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"214","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"550","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"829","ViewID":"1008"},{"CweID":"830","ViewID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See member weaknesses of this category.","Reasons":["Category"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"Joanna C.S.
