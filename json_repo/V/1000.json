{"ID":"1000","Name":"Research Concepts","Type":"Graph","Status":"Draft","Objective":"This view is intended to facilitate research into weaknesses, including their inter-dependencies, and can be leveraged to systematically identify theoretical gaps within CWE. It is mainly organized according to abstractions of behaviors instead of how they can be detected, where they appear in code, or when they are introduced in the development life cycle. By design, this view is expected to include every weakness within CWE.","Audience":[{"Type":"Academic Researchers","Description":"Academic researchers can use the high-level classes that lack a significant number of children to identify potential areas for future research."},{"Type":"Vulnerability Analysts","Description":"Those who perform vulnerability discovery/analysis use this view to identify related weaknesses that might be leveraged by following relationships between higher-level classes and bases."},{"Type":"Assessment Tool Vendors","Description":"Assessment vendors often use this view to help identify additional weaknesses that a tool may be able to detect as the relationships are more aligned with a tool's technical capabilities."}],"Members":[{"CweID":"284","ViewID":"1000"},{"CweID":"435","ViewID":"1000"},{"CweID":"664","ViewID":"1000"},{"CweID":"682","ViewID":"1000"},{"CweID":"691","ViewID":"1000"},{"CweID":"693","ViewID":"1000"},{"CweID":"697","ViewID":"1000"},{"CweID":"703","ViewID":"1000"},{"CweID":"707","ViewID":"1000"},{"CweID":"710","ViewID":"1000"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a View. Views are not weaknesses and therefore inappropriate to describe the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Use this View or other Views to search and navigate for the appropriate weakness.","Reasons":["View"]},"Notes":[{"Type":"Other","Note":"This view uses a deep hierarchical organization, with more levels of abstraction than other classification schemes. The top-level entries are called Pillars. Where possible, this view uses abstractions that do not consider particular languages, frameworks, technologies, life cycle development phases, frequency of occurrence, or types of resources. It explicitly identifies relationships that form chains and composites, which have not been a formal part of past classification efforts. Chains and composites might help explain why mutual exclusivity is difficult to achieve within security error taxonomies. This view is roughly aligned with MITRE's research into vulnerability theory, especially with respect to behaviors and resources. Ideally, this view will only cover weakness-to-weakness relationships, with minimal overlap and zero categories.  It is expected to include at least one parent/child relationship for every weakness within CWE."}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Content Team","SubmissionOrganization":"MITRE","SubmissionDate":"2008-04-11","SubmissionVersion":"Draft 9","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2008-04-11"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-09-08","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Name, Relationships, View_Audience, View_Structure"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2010-02-16","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2018-03-27","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Other_Notes, View_Audience"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships, View_Audience"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2021-03-15","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Other_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Natural Hierarchy","Date":"2008-09-09"}]}
