The 2025 MIHW aims to drive awareness of\n            critical hardware weaknesses and provide the cybersecurity\n            community with practical guidance to prevent security\n            issues at the source. By combining advanced data analysis\n            with expert consensus, the list helps organizations\n            prioritize mitigations, strengthen design practices, and\n            make informed decisions throughout the hardware\n            lifecycle.\n\t    ","Audience":[{"Type":"Hardware Designers","Description":"Address key security weaknesses during hardware design process."},{"Type":"Product Customers","Description":"Evaluate products for critical security weaknesses and enforce supplier security standards."},{"Type":"Applied Researchers","Description":"Investigate selected weaknesses and develop new mitigation strategies."},{"Type":"Academic Researchers","Description":"Identify gaps in foundational security models to develop advanced approaches."},{"Type":"Assessment Teams","Description":"Focus testing on high-priority hardware security weaknesses."},{"Type":"Assessment Tool Vendors","Description":"Improve automated tools to detect critical security weaknesses."},{"Type":"Educators","Description":"Structure course content and research projects around hardware security weaknesses."}],"Members":[{"CweID":"226","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1189","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1191","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1234","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1247","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1256","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1260","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1262","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1300","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1421","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1423","ViewID":"1432"},{"CweID":"1433","ViewID":"1432"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1480"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1483"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a View.
