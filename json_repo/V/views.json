It explicitly identifies relationships that form chains and composites, which have not been a formal part of past classification efforts. Chains and composites might help explain why mutual exclusivity is difficult to achieve within security error taxonomies. This view is roughly aligned with MITRE's research into vulnerability theory, especially with respect to behaviors and resources.
