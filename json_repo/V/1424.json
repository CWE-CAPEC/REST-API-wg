{"ID":"1424","Name":"Weaknesses Addressed by ISA/IEC 62443 Requirements","Type":"Implicit","Status":"Draft","Objective":"This view (slice) covers weaknesses that are addressed by following requirements in the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards for industrial automation and control systems (IACS). Members of the CWE ICS/OT SIG analyzed a set of CWEs and mapped them to specific requirements covered by ISA/IEC 62443. These mappings are recorded in Taxonomy_Mapping elements.","MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a View. Views are not weaknesses and therefore inappropriate to describe the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Use this View or other Views to search and navigate for the appropriate weakness.","Reasons":["View"]},"Notes":[{"Type":"Maintenance","Note":"The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added between CWE 4.9 and CWE 4.14, but some mappings are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG)."}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Content Team","SubmissionOrganization":"MITRE","SubmissionDate":"2024-02-14","SubmissionVersion":"4.14","SubmissionReleaseDate":"2024-02-29"}]}
