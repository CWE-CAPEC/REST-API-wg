# CWE/CAPEC REST API Working Group

## Overview

The CWE/CAPEC program -- operated by the CISA-funded Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDI) -- is operating a community-driven effort to standardize a JSON based API for CWE/CAPEC.  The CWE/CAPEC REST API Working Group is underway to ease the interface between security SW and HW architects, EDA tool developers, verification engineers concerned about mitigating security risks in their products; and the datasets themselves. A new RESTful API will be designed.

You are invited to join this effort and become a member of the Working Group performing the work to:

1. Craft the RESTful API syntax and semantics which users will send to the CWE and CAPEC dataset web services;
2. Determine which content and syntax the datasets will be delivered in content back to the users;
3. Determine if there are structures or content missing from these datasets which would complete a link between this content and that required for tools and standards (such as the Accellera SA-EDI standard); and
4. List any structure or content missing from these datasets that would help with further automation (such as versioning, etc.).
5. Collaboratively determine performance/scalability requirements by providing abstract use cases

The group meets on a biweekly basis on Thursday mornings at 9am ET. The Working Group will provide development and design support and deliver artifacts that can be used by MITRE to craft the required infrastructure to support the RESTful API. At the end of this process, the Working Group will provide deliver a document and any other collateral that can be used by MITRE to craft the required infrastructure to support the RESTful API.

Please contact a.cron@ieee.org if you are interested in actively participating in this effort.

Chair, CWE/CAPEC REST API Working Group
