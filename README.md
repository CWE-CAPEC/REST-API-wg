### CWE REST API Working Group

- Co-Chair: Adam Cron (Synopsys)
- Co-chair: Rich Piazza (MITRE)

The CWE™ Program – operated by the CISA-funded Homeland Security Systems Engineering and
Development Institute (HSSEDI) – is pleased to offer the CWE REST API, a community-driven effort driven
by the CWE REST API Working Group. The purpose of the API is to ease the interface between security
SW and HW architects, EDA tool developers, verification engineers concerned about mitigating security
risks in their products; and the databases themselves.

Most of the work of this group has been completed. We are now in a transitionary stage as the working
group shifts from the design phase of this work to the rollout of a minimal viable product (MVP).

The Working Group no longer meets regularly. Most of its work takes place on its email list. However,
the discussion of enhancements to the API could necessitate scheduling meetings in the future.

If you wish to be added to the list, please contact one of the co-chairs at a.cron@ieee.org or
rpiazza@mitre.org. Additionally. feel free to contact us if you would like to explore the current version
of the API.
