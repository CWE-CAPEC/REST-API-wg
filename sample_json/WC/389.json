{"ID":"389","Name":"Error Conditions, Return Values, Status Codes","Status":"Incomplete","Summary":"This category includes weaknesses that occur if a function does not generate the correct return/status code, or if the application does not handle all possible return/status codes that could be generated by a function. This type of problem is most often found in conditions that are rarely encountered during the normal operation of the product. Presumably, most bugs related to common conditions are found and eliminated during development and testing. In some cases, the attacker can directly control or influence the environment to trigger the rare conditions.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"209","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"248","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"252","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"253","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"390","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"391","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"392","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"393","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"394","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"395","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"396","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"397","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"544","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"584","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"617","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"756","View_ID":"699"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-44","Authors":["Michael Howard","David LeBlanc","John Viega"],"Title":"24 Deadly Sins of Software Security","Publication":"McGraw-Hill","PublicationYear":"2010"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing.

However, since 2005 it seems to be reported more frequently than in the past.
