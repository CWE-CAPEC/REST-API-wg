{"ID":"1009","Name":"Audit","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of audit-based components of the system. Frequently these deal with logging user activities in order to identify attackers and modifications to the system. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality of the audit capability if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"117","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"223","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"224","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"532","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"778","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"779","View_ID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9","Authors":["Santos, J.
