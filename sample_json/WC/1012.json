{"ID":"1012","Name":"Cross Cutting","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of multiple security tactics and how they affect a system. For example, information exposure can impact the Limit Access and Limit Exposure security tactics. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality of many capabilities if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"208","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"392","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"460","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"544","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"602","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"703","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"754","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"784","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"807","View_ID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9","Authors":["Santos, J.
