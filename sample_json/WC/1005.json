{"ID":"1005","Name":"7PK - Input Validation and Representation","Status":"Draft","Summary":"This category represents one of the phyla in the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms vulnerability classification. It includes weaknesses that exist when an application does not properly validate or represent input. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, \"Input validation and representation problems are caused by metacharacters, alternate encodings and numeric representations. Security problems result from trusting input.\"","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"20","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"77","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"79","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"89","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"99","View_ID":"700"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-6","Authors":["Katrina Tsipenyuk","Brian Chess","Gary McGraw"],"Title":"Seven Pernicious Kingdoms: A Taxonomy of Software Security Errors","Publication":"NIST Workshop on Software Security Assurance Tools Techniques and Metrics","PublicationYear":"2005","PublicationMonth":"11","PublicationDay":"07","Publisher":"NIST","URL":"https://samate.nist.gov/SSATTM_Content/papers/Seven%20Pernicious%20Kingdoms%20-%20Taxonomy%20of%20Sw%20Security%20Errors%20-%20Tsipenyuk%20-%20Chess%20-%20McGraw.pdf"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See member weaknesses of this category.","Reasons":["Category"]},"Content_History":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"7 Pernicious Kingdoms","SubmissionDate":"2017-05-05"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-11-08","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Name, References"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated References"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Seven Pernicious Kingdoms Category: Input Validation and Representation","Date":"2017-11-08"}]}
