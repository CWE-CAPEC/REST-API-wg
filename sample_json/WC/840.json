{"ID":"840","Name":"Business Logic Errors","Status":"Incomplete","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category identify some of the underlying problems that commonly allow attackers to manipulate the business logic of an application. Errors in business logic can be devastating to an entire application. They can be difficult to find automatically, since they typically involve legitimate use of the application's functionality. However, many business logic errors can exhibit patterns that are similar to well-understood implementation and design weaknesses.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"283","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"639","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"640","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"708","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"770","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"826","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"837","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"841","View_ID":"699"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-795","Authors":["Jeremiah Grossman"],"Title":"Business Logic Flaws and Yahoo Games","PublicationYear":"2006","PublicationMonth":"12","PublicationDay":"08","URL":"https://blog.jeremiahgrossman.com/2006/12/business-logic-flaws.html","URLDate":"2023-04-07"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-796","Authors":["Jeremiah Grossman"],"Title":"Seven Business Logic Flaws That Put Your Website At Risk","PublicationYear":"2007","PublicationMonth":"10","URL":"https://docplayer.net/10021793-Seven-business-logic-flaws-that-put-your-website-at-risk.html","URLDate":"2023-04-07"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-797","Authors":["WhiteHat Security"],"Title":"Business Logic Flaws","URL":"https://web.archive.org/web/20080720171327/http://www.whitehatsec.com/home/solutions/BL_auction.html","URLDate":"2023-04-07"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-798","Authors":["WASC"],"Title":"Abuse of Functionality","URL":"http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246913/Abuse-of-Functionality"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-799","Authors":["Rafal Los","Prajakta Jagdale"],"Title":"Defying Logic: Theory, Design, and Implementation of Complex Systems for Testing Application Logic","PublicationYear":"2011","URL":"https://www.slideshare.net/RafalLos/defying-logic-business-logic-testing-with-automation","URLDate":"2023-04-07"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-667","Authors":["Rafal Los"],"Title":"Real-Life Example of a 'Business Logic Defect' (Screen Shots!)","PublicationYear":"2011","URL":"http://h30501.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-White-Rabbit-A/Real-Life-Example-of-a-Business-Logic-Defect-Screen-Shots/ba-p/22581"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-801","Authors":["Viktoria Felmetsger","Ludovico Cavedon","Christopher Kruegel","Giovanni Vigna"],"Title":"Toward Automated Detection of Logic Vulnerabilities in Web Applications","Publication":"USENIX Security Symposium 2010","PublicationYear":"2010","PublicationMonth":"08","URL":"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec10/tech/full_papers/Felmetsger.pdf","URLDate":"2023-04-07"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-802","Authors":["Faisal Nabi"],"Title":"Designing a Framework Method for Secure Business Application Logic Integrity in e-Commerce Systems","Publication":"International Journal of Network Security, Vol.12, No.1","PublicationYear":"2011","URL":"http://ijns.femto.com.tw/contents/ijns-v12-n1/ijns-2011-v12-n1-p29-41.pdf"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1102","Authors":["Chetan Conikee"],"Title":"Case Files from 20 Years of Business Logic Flaws","PublicationYear":"2020","PublicationMonth":"02","URL":"https://published-prd.lanyonevents.com/published/rsaus20/sessionsFiles/18217/2020_USA20_DSO-R02_01_Case%20Files%20from%2020%20Years%20of%20Business%20Logic%20Flaws.pdf"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.

Such issues might not be easily detectable via automatic code analysis, because the associated operations do not produce clear errors or undefined behavior at the code level.
