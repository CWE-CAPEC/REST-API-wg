Validation is a frequently-used technique for ensuring that data conforms to expectations before it is further processed as input or output.  There are many varieties of validation (see CWE-20, which is just for input validation). Validation is distinct from other techniques that attempt to modify data before processing it, although developers may consider all attempts to product \"safe\" inputs or outputs as some kind of validation.  Regardless, validation is a powerful tool that is often used to minimize malformed data from entering the system, or indirectly avoid code injection or other potentially-malicious patterns when generating output.

It includes weaknesses that involve the software using an API in a manner contrary to its intended use. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, \"An API is a contract between a caller and a callee. The most common forms of API misuse occurs when the caller does not honor its end of this contract. For example, if a program does not call chdir() after calling chroot(), it violates the contract that specifies how to change the active root directory in a secure fashion. Another good example of library abuse is expecting the callee to return trustworthy DNS information to the caller. In this case, the caller misuses the callee API by making certain assumptions about its behavior (that the return value can be used for authentication purposes). One can also violate the caller-callee contract from the other side. For example, if a coder subclasses SecureRandom and returns a non-random value, the contract is violated.\"","Taxonomy_Mappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"WIN30-C","EntryName":"Properly pair allocation and deallocation functions","MappingFit":"CWE More Abstract"}],"Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"242","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"243","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"244","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"245","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"246","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"248","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"250","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"251","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"252","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"558","View_ID":"700"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-6","Authors":["Katrina Tsipenyuk","Brian Chess","Gary McGraw"],"Title":"Seven Pernicious Kingdoms: A Taxonomy of Software Security Errors","Publication":"NIST Workshop on Software Security Assurance Tools Techniques and Metrics","PublicationYear":"2005","PublicationMonth":"11","PublicationDay":"07","Publisher":"NIST","URL":"https://samate.nist.gov/SSATTM_Content/papers/Seven%20Pernicious%20Kingdoms%20-%20Taxonomy%20of%20Sw%20Security%20Errors%20-%20Tsipenyuk%20-%20Chess%20-%20McGraw.pdf"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.

It includes weaknesses related to the improper management of time and state in an environment that supports simultaneous or near-simultaneous computation by multiple systems, processes, or threads. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, \"Distributed computation is about time and state. That is, in order for more than one component to communicate, state must be shared, and all that takes time. Most programmers anthropomorphize their work. They think about one thread of control carrying out the entire program in the same way they would if they had to do the job themselves. Modern computers, however, switch between tasks very quickly, and in multi-core, multi-CPU, or distributed systems, two events may take place at exactly the same time. Defects rush to fill the gap between the programmer's model of how a program executes and what happens in reality. These defects are related to unexpected interactions between threads, processes, time, and information. These interactions happen through shared state: semaphores, variables, the file system, and, basically, anything that can store information.\"","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"364","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"367","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"377","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"382","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"383","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"384","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"412","View_ID":"700"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-6","Authors":["Katrina Tsipenyuk","Brian Chess","Gary McGraw"],"Title":"Seven Pernicious Kingdoms: A Taxonomy of Software Security Errors","Publication":"NIST Workshop on Software Security Assurance Tools Techniques and Metrics","PublicationYear":"2005","PublicationMonth":"11","PublicationDay":"07","Publisher":"NIST","URL":"https://samate.nist.gov/SSATTM_Content/papers/Seven%20Pernicious%20Kingdoms%20-%20Taxonomy%20of%20Sw%20Security%20Errors%20-%20Tsipenyuk%20-%20Chess%20-%20McGraw.pdf"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
