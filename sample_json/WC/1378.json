{"ID":"1378","Name":"ICS Operations (\u0026 Maintenance): Gaps in obligations and training","Status":"Incomplete","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the \"Gaps in obligations and training\" category from the SEI ETF \"Categories of Security Vulnerabilities in ICS\" as published in March 2022: \"OT ownership and responsibility for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities are not clearly defined or communicated within an organization, leaving environments unpatched, exploitable, and with a broader attack surface.\" Note: members of this category include \"Nearest IT Neighbor\" recommendations from the report, as well as suggestions by the CWE team. These relationships are likely to change in future CWE versions.","References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1261","Authors":["Sam Weber","Paul A.

After the release of CWE 4.9 in October 2022, this has been under active review by members of the \"Boosting CWE\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG). Subgroup members did not find any CWEs to add to this category in CWE 4.11.
