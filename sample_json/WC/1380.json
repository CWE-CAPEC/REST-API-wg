{"ID":"1380","Name":"ICS Operations (\u0026 Maintenance): Post-analysis changes","Status":"Incomplete","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the \"Post-analysis changes\" category from the SEI ETF \"Categories of Security Vulnerabilities in ICS\" as published in March 2022: \"Changes made to a previously analyzed and approved ICS environment can introduce new security vulnerabilities (as opposed to safety).\" Note: members of this category include \"Nearest IT Neighbor\" recommendations from the report, as well as suggestions by the CWE team. These relationships are likely to change in future CWE versions.","References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1248","Authors":["Securing Energy Infrastructure Executive Task Force (SEI ETF)"],"Title":"Categories of Security Vulnerabilities in ICS","PublicationYear":"2022","PublicationMonth":"03","PublicationDay":"09","URL":"https://inl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SEI-ETF-NCSV-TPT-Categories-of-Security-Vulnerabilities-ICS-v1_03-09-22.pdf"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.

After the release of CWE 4.9 in October 2022, this has been under active review by members of the \"Boosting CWE\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG). Subgroup members did not find any CWEs to add to this category in CWE 4.11. There may be some gaps with respect to CWE's current scope, which will require consultation with many CWE stakeholders to resolve."}],"Content_History":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"New Categories of Security Vulnerabilities (NCSV) Technical Project Team (TPT)","SubmissionOrganization":"Securing Energy Infrastructure Executive Task Force","SubmissionDate":"2022-03-09"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-01-31","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Maintenance_Notes, Relationship_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated Maintenance_Notes, Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"}]}
