{"ID":"3","Name":"DEPRECATED: Technology-specific Environment Issues","Status":"Deprecated","Summary":"This category has been deprecated. It was originally intended as a \"catch-all\" for environment issues for technologies that did not have their own CWE, but it introduced unnecessary depth and complexity to the Development View (CWE-699).","MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This CWE has been deprecated. It is also a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves.","Comments":"See the summary, which might have suggestions for other CWEs to consider.","Reasons":["Category","Deprecated"]},"Content_History":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Community","SubmissionDate":"2006-07-19"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-09-08","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-01-19","ModificationComment":"updated Maintenance_Notes, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-11-08","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Maintenance_Notes, Name, Type"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Technology-specific Environment Issues","Date":"2017-11-08"}]}
