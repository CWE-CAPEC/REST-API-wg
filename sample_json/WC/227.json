{"ID":"227","Name":"7PK - API Abuse","Status":"Draft","Summary":"This category represents one of the phyla in the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms vulnerability classification. It includes weaknesses that involve the software using an API in a manner contrary to its intended use. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, \"An API is a contract between a caller and a callee. The most common forms of API misuse occurs when the caller does not honor its end of this contract. For example, if a program does not call chdir() after calling chroot(), it violates the contract that specifies how to change the active root directory in a secure fashion. Another good example of library abuse is expecting the callee to return trustworthy DNS information to the caller. In this case, the caller misuses the callee API by making certain assumptions about its behavior (that the return value can be used for authentication purposes). One can also violate the caller-callee contract from the other side. For example, if a coder subclasses SecureRandom and returns a non-random value, the contract is violated.\"","Taxonomy_Mappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"WIN30-C","EntryName":"Properly pair allocation and deallocation functions","MappingFit":"CWE More Abstract"}],"Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"242","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"243","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"244","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"245","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"246","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"248","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"250","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"251","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"252","View_ID":"700"},{"CWE_ID":"558","View_ID":"700"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-6","Authors":["Katrina Tsipenyuk","Brian Chess","Gary McGraw"],"Title":"Seven Pernicious Kingdoms: A Taxonomy of Software Security Errors","Publication":"NIST Workshop on Software Security Assurance Tools Techniques and Metrics","PublicationYear":"2005","PublicationMonth":"11","PublicationDay":"07","Publisher":"NIST","URL":"https://samate.nist.gov/SSATTM_Content/papers/Seven%20Pernicious%20Kingdoms%20-%20Taxonomy%20of%20Sw%20Security%20Errors%20-%20Tsipenyuk%20-%20Chess%20-%20McGraw.pdf"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
