{"ID":"1014","Name":"Identify Actors","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of a system's identification management components. Frequently these deal with verifying that external agents provide inputs into the system. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality of identification management if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"295","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"296","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"297","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"298","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"299","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"345","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"346","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"370","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"441","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"599","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"940","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"941","View_ID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9","Authors":["Santos, J.
