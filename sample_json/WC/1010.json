{"ID":"1010","Name":"Authenticate Actors","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of authentication components of the system. Frequently these deal with verifying the entity is indeed who it claims to be. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality of authentication if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"258","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"259","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"262","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"263","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"287","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"288","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"289","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"290","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"291","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"293","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"294","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"301","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"302","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"303","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"304","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"305","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"306","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"307","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"308","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"322","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"521","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"593","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"603","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"620","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"640","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"798","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"836","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"916","View_ID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9","Authors":["Santos, J.
