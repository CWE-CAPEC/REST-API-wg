{"ID":"1016","Name":"Limit Exposure","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and architecture of the entry points to a system. Frequently these deal with minimizing the attack surface through designing the system with the least needed amount of entry points. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of a system's defenses if they are not addressed when designing or implementing a secure architecture.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"210","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"211","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"214","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"550","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"829","View_ID":"1008"},{"CWE_ID":"830","View_ID":"1008"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-9","Authors":["Santos, J.
