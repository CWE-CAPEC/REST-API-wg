{"ID":"1370","Name":"ICS Supply Chain: Common Mode Frailties","Status":"Incomplete","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to the \"Common Mode Frailties\" category from the SEI ETF \"Categories of Security Vulnerabilities in ICS\" as published in March 2022: \"At the component level, most ICS systems are assembled from common parts made by other companies. One or more of these common parts might contain a vulnerability that could result in a wide-spread incident.\" Note: members of this category include \"Nearest IT Neighbor\" recommendations from the report, as well as suggestions by the CWE team. These relationships are likely to change in future CWE versions.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"664","View_ID":"1358"},{"CWE_ID":"707","View_ID":"1358"},{"CWE_ID":"710","View_ID":"1358"},{"CWE_ID":"1357","View_ID":"1358"},{"CWE_ID":"329","View_ID":"1358"},{"CWE_ID":"693","View_ID":"1358"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1260","Authors":["Thu T.
