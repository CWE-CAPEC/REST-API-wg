{"ID":"1212","Name":"Authorization Errors","Status":"Draft","Summary":"Weaknesses in this category are related to authorization components of a system. Frequently these deal with the ability to enforce that agents have the required permissions before performing certain operations, such as modifying data. If not addressed when designing or implementing a software system, these weaknesses could lead to a degradation of the quality of the authorization capability.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"425","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"551","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"552","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"639","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"653","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"939","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"842","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"1220","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"1230","View_ID":"699"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
