Frequently these deal with the ability to ensure the integrity of data, such as messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of data integrity quality if they are not addressed.","Relationships":[{"CWE_ID":"322","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"346","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"347","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"348","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"349","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"351","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"353","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"354","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"494","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"565","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"649","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"829","View_ID":"699"},{"CWE_ID":"924","View_ID":"699"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a Category.
