Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.","Effectiveness":"High"}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2005-2225","Description":"Product sees dangerous file extension in free text of a group discussion, disconnects all users.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2225"},{"Reference":"CVE-2001-0003","Description":"Product does not correctly import and process security settings from another product.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0003"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Misinterpretation Error"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
