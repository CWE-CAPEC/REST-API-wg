If untrusted IPs or peripheral microcontrollers are enabled first, then the untrusted component can master transactions on the hardware bus and target memory or other assets to compromise the SoC boot firmware.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"696","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Access Control"],"Impact":["Bypass Protection Mechanism"],"Likelihood":["High"],"Note":"An untrusted component can master transactions on the HW bus and target memory or other assets to compromise the SoC boot firmware."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"\n\nThe boot sequence should enable fabric access controls and memory protections before enabling third-party hardware IPs and peripheral microcontrollers that use untrusted firmware.\n"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["1","180"],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
