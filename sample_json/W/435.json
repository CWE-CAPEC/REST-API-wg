{"ID":"435","Name":"Improper Interaction Between Multiple Correctly-Behaving Entities","Abstraction":"Pillar","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"An interaction error occurs when two entities have correct behavior when running independently of each other, but when they are integrated as components in a larger system or process, they introduce incorrect behaviors that may cause resultant weaknesses.","ExtendedDescription":"When a system or process combines multiple independent components, this often produces new, emergent behaviors at the system level. However, if the interactions between these components are not fully accounted for, some of the emergent behaviors can be incorrect or even insecure.","ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"Interaction Error"},{"Term":"Emergent Fault"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Unexpected State","Varies by Context"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Interaction Errors"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Discouraged","Rationale":"This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

When one or more of the products do not comply with specifications, then it is more likely to be API Abuse (CWE-227) or an interpretation conflict (CWE-436). This distinction can be blurred in real world scenarios, especially when \"de facto\" standards do not comply with specifications, or when there are no standards but there is widespread adoption. As a result, it can be difficult to distinguish these weaknesses during mapping and classification."}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"PLOVER","SubmissionDate":"2006-07-19"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"Eric Dalci","ModificationOrganization":"Cigital","ModificationDate":"2008-07-01","ModificationComment":"updated Time_of_Introduction"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-09-08","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships, Relationship_Notes, Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-10-14","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-11-24","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2011-06-01","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2011-06-27","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2012-05-11","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2014-07-30","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2015-12-07","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-01-19","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-11-08","ModificationComment":"updated Applicable_Platforms, Name, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2018-03-27","ModificationComment":"updated Alternate_Terms, Description, Name, References, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2019-06-20","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated Applicable_Platforms, Type"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated References, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes, Research_Gaps"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Interaction Errors","Date":"2008-04-11"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Interaction Error","Date":"2017-11-08"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Improper Interaction Between Multiple Entities","Date":"2018-03-27"}]}
