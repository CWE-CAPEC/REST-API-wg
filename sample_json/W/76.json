{"ID":"76","Name":"Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product correctly neutralizes certain special elements, but it improperly neutralizes equivalent special elements.","ExtendedDescription":"The product may have a fixed list of special characters it believes is complete. However, there may be alternate encodings, or representations that also have the same meaning. For example, the product may filter out a leading slash (/) to prevent absolute path names, but does not account for a tilde (~) followed by a user name, which on some *nix systems could be expanded to an absolute pathname. Alternately, the product might filter a dangerous \"-e\" command-line switch when calling an external program, but it might not account for \"--exec\" or other switches that have the same semantics.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"High","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"75","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Other"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Requirements"],"Description":"Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Utilize an appropriate mix of allowlist and denylist parsing to filter equivalent special element syntax from all input."}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Equivalent Special Element Injection"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
