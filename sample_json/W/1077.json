{"ID":"1077","Name":"Floating Point Comparison with Incorrect Operator","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The code performs a comparison such as an\n        equality test between two float (floating point) values, but\n        it uses comparison operators that do not account for the\n        possibility of loss of precision.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nNumeric calculation using floating point values can generate imprecise results because of rounding errors. As a result, two different calculations might generate numbers that are mathematically equal, but have slightly different bit representations that do not translate to the same mathematically-equal values. As a result, an equality test or other comparison might produce unexpected results.\n\n\nThis issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"697","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Reliability"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCRM","EntryID":"ASCRM-RLB-9"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
