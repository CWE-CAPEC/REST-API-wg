{"ID":"127","Name":"Buffer Under-read","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.","ExtendedDescription":"This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"125","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"786","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Memory"]},{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Bypass Protection Mechanism"],"Note":"By reading out-of-bounds memory, an attacker might be able to get secret values, such as memory addresses, which can be bypass protection mechanisms such as ASLR in order to improve the reliability and likelihood of exploiting a separate weakness to achieve code execution instead of just denial of service."}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Buffer under-read"},{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP8","EntryName":"Faulty Buffer Access"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
