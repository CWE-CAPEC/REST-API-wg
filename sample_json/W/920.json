{"ID":"920","Name":"Improper Restriction of Power Consumption","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product operates in an environment in which power is a limited resource that cannot be automatically replenished, but the product does not properly restrict the amount of power that its operation consumes.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nIn environments such as embedded or mobile devices, power can be a limited resource such as a battery, which cannot be automatically replenished by the product itself, and the device might not always be directly attached to a reliable power source. If the product uses too much power too quickly, then this could cause the device (and subsequently, the product) to stop functioning until power is restored, or increase the financial burden on the device owner because of increased power costs.\n\n\nNormal operation of an application will consume power. However, in some cases, an attacker could cause the application to consume more power than intended, using components such as:\n\n\n  - Display\n\n  - CPU\n\n  - Disk I/O\n\n  - GPS\n\n  - Sound\n\n  - Microphone\n\n  - USB interface\n\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"400","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"400","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Mobile","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)","DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"],"Note":"The power source could be drained, causing the application - and the entire device - to cease functioning."}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"ISA/IEC 62443","EntryID":"Part 3-3","EntryName":"Req SR 6.2"},{"TaxonomyName":"ISA/IEC 62443","EntryID":"Part 4-2","EntryName":"Req CR 6.2"},{"TaxonomyName":"ISA/IEC 62443","EntryID":"Part 4-1","EntryName":"Req SD-4"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
