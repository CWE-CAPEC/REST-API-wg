This issue can also make the product more costly and difficult to maintain.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"710","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"},{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Maintainability"]}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed-with-Review","Rationale":"This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate","Comments":"Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit","Reasons":["Abstraction"]},"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1009","Authors":["Tim Rains"],"Title":"Microsoft's Free Security Tools - banned.h","PublicationYear":"2012","PublicationMonth":"08","PublicationDay":"30","URL":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2012/08/30/microsofts-free-security-tools-banned-h/","URLDate":"2023-04-07"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1010","Authors":["Michael Howard"],"Title":"Microsoft's Free Security Tools - banned.h","PublicationYear":"2011","PublicationMonth":"06","URL":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2012/08/30/microsofts-free-security-tools-banned-h/","URLDate":"2023-04-07"}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Content Team","SubmissionOrganization":"MITRE","SubmissionDate":"2019-01-03"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated References, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-01-31","ModificationComment":"updated Description"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated References, Relationships, Time_of_Introduction"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"}]}
