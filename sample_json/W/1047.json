{"ID":"1047","Name":"Modules with Circular Dependencies","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product contains modules in which one module has references that cycle back to itself, i.e., there are circular dependencies.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nAs an example, with Java, this weakness might indicate cycles between packages.\n\n\nThis issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product due to insufficient modularity, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThis issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1120","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Reliability"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCMM","EntryID":"ASCMM-MNT-7"},{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCRM","EntryID":"ASCRM-RLB-13"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
