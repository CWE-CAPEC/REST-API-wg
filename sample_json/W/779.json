{"ID":"779","Name":"Logging of Excessive Data","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product logs too much information, making log files hard to process and possibly hindering recovery efforts or forensic analysis after an attack.","ExtendedDescription":"While logging is a good practice in general, and very high levels of logging are appropriate for debugging stages of development, too much logging in a production environment might hinder a system administrator's ability to detect anomalous conditions. This can provide cover for an attacker while attempting to penetrate a system, clutter the audit trail for forensic analysis, or make it more difficult to debug problems in a production environment.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Low","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"400","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Operation","Note":"REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)","DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)"],"Note":"Log files can become so large that they consume excessive resources, such as disk and CPU, which can hinder the performance of the system."},{"Scope":["Non-Repudiation"],"Impact":["Hide Activities"],"Note":"Logging too much information can make the log files of less use to forensics analysts and developers when trying to diagnose a problem or recover from an attack."},{"Scope":["Non-Repudiation"],"Impact":["Hide Activities"],"Note":"If system administrators are unable to effectively process log files, attempted attacks may go undetected, possibly leading to eventual system compromise."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Suppress large numbers of duplicate log messages and replace them with periodic summaries.
