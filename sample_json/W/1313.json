{"ID":"1313","Name":"Hardware Allows Activation of Test or Debug Logic at Runtime","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"During runtime, the hardware allows for test or debug logic (feature) to be activated, which allows for changing the state of the hardware. This feature can alter the intended behavior of the system and allow for alteration and leakage of sensitive data by an adversary.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nAn adversary can take advantage of test or debug logic that is made accessible through the hardware during normal operation to modify the intended behavior of the system. For example, an accessible Test/debug mode may allow read/write access to any system data. Using error injection (a common test/debug feature) during a transmit/receive operation on a bus, data may be modified to produce an unintended message. Similarly, confidentiality could be compromised by such features allowing access to secrets.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"284","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"Such issues could be introduced during hardware architecture and design and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases."},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"Such issues could be introduced during implementation and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases."},{"Phase":"Integration","Note":"Such issues could be introduced during integration and identified later during Testing or System configuration phases."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","Read Memory","DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart","DoS: Instability","DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)","DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory)","DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)","Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands","Gain Privileges or Assume Identity","Bypass Protection Mechanism","Alter Execution Logic","Quality Degradation","Unexpected State","Reduce Performance","Reduce Reliability"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Insert restrictions on when the hardware's test or debug features can be activated.
