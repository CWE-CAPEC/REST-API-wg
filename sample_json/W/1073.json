{"ID":"1073","Name":"Non-SQL Invokable Control Element with Excessive Number of Data Resource Accesses","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product contains a client with a function or method that contains a large number of data accesses/queries that are sent through a data manager, i.e., does not use efficient database capabilities.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n\n\nWhile the interpretation of \"large number of data accesses/queries\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 2 data accesses per function/method.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"405","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Performance"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCPEM","EntryID":"ASCPEM-PRF-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
