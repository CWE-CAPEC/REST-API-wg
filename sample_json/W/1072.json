{"ID":"1072","Name":"Data Resource Access without Use of Connection Pooling","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product accesses a data resource through a database without using a\n\t\t\t\t\tconnection pooling capability.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis issue can make the product perform more slowly, as connection pools allow connections to be reused without the overhead and time consumption of opening and closing a new connection.
