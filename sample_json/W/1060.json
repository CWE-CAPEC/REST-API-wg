{"ID":"1060","Name":"Excessive Number of Inefficient Server-Side Data Accesses","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product performs too many data queries without using efficient data processing functionality such as stored procedures.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis issue can make the product perform more slowly due to computational expense. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n\n\nWhile the interpretation of \"too many data queries\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 5 data queries for an inefficient function/procedure.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1120","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Performance"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCPEM","EntryID":"ASCPEM-PRF-9"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
