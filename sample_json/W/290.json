Attackers can easily forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2009-1048","Description":"VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1048"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Authentication bypass by spoofing"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["21","22","459","461","473","476","59","60","667","94"],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
