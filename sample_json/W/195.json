{"ID":"195","Name":"Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an unsigned primitive, which can produce an unexpected value if the value of the signed primitive can not be represented using an unsigned primitive.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nIt is dangerous to rely on implicit casts between signed and unsigned numbers because the result can take on an unexpected value and violate assumptions made by the program.\n\n\nOften, functions will return negative values to indicate a failure. When the result of a function is to be used as a size parameter, using these negative return values can have unexpected results. For example, if negative size values are passed to the standard memory copy or allocation functions they will be implicitly cast to a large unsigned value. This may lead to an exploitable buffer overflow or underflow condition.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"681","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"681","ViewID":"1305","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"681","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"119","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Unexpected State"],"Note":"Conversion between signed and unsigned values can lead to a variety of errors, but from a security standpoint is most commonly associated with integer overflow and buffer overflow vulnerabilities."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
