{"ID":"626","Name":"Null Byte Interaction Error (Poison Null Byte)","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product does not properly handle null bytes or NUL characters when passing data between different representations or components.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nA null byte (NUL character) can have different meanings across representations or languages. For example, it is a string terminator in standard C libraries, but Perl and PHP strings do not treat it as a terminator. When two representations are crossed - such as when Perl or PHP invokes underlying C functionality - this can produce an interaction error with unexpected results. Similar issues have been reported for ASP. Other interpreters written in C might also be affected.\n\n\nThe poison null byte is frequently useful in path traversal attacks by terminating hard-coded extensions that are added to a filename. It can play a role in regular expression processing in PHP.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"147","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"436","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"PHP","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"Perl","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"ASP.NET","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Unexpected State"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Remove null bytes from all incoming strings."}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2005-4155","Description":"NUL byte bypasses PHP regular expression check","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4155"},{"Reference":"CVE-2005-3153","Description":"inserting SQL after a NUL byte bypasses allowlist regexp, enabling SQL injection","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-3153"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
