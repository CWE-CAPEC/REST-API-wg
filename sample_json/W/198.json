{"ID":"198","Name":"Use of Incorrect Byte Ordering","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not account for byte ordering (e.g. big-endian and little-endian) when processing the input, causing an incorrect number or value to be used.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"188","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Unexpected State"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Black Box","Description":"Because byte ordering bugs are usually very noticeable even with normal inputs, this bug is more likely to occur in rarely triggered error conditions, making them difficult to detect using black box methods."}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Numeric Byte Ordering Error"},{"TaxonomyName":"The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)","EntryID":"FIO12-J","EntryName":"Provide methods to read and write little-endian data"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
