{"ID":"1317","Name":"Improper Access Control in Fabric Bridge","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product uses a fabric bridge for transactions between two Intellectual Property (IP) blocks, but the bridge does not properly perform the expected privilege, identity, or other access control checks between those IP blocks.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nIn hardware designs, different IP blocks are connected through interconnect-bus fabrics (e.g. AHB and OCP). Within a System on Chip (SoC), the IP block subsystems could be using different bus protocols. In such a case, the IP blocks are then linked to the central bus (and to other IP blocks) through a fabric bridge. Bridges are used as bus-interconnect-routing modules that link different protocols or separate, different segments of the overall SoC interconnect.\n\n\nFor overall system security, it is important that the access-control privileges associated with any fabric transaction are consistently maintained and applied, even when they are routed or translated by a fabric bridge. A bridge that is connected to a fabric without security features forwards transactions to the slave without checking the privilege level of the master and results in a weakness in SoC access-control security. The same weakness occurs if a bridge does not check the hardware identity of the transaction received from the slave interface of the bridge.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"284","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Processor Hardware","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Access Control","Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart","Bypass Protection Mechanism","Read Memory","Modify Memory"],"Likelihood":["Medium"]}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Simulation / Emulation","Description":"RTL simulation to ensure that bridge-access controls are implemented properly.","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Method":"Formal Verification","Description":"Formal verification of bridge RTL to ensure that access control cannot be bypassed.","Effectiveness":"High"}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Ensure that the design includes provisions for access-control checks in the bridge for both upstream and downstream transactions."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Implement access-control checks in the bridge for both upstream and downstream transactions."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"This example is from CVE-2019-6260 [REF-1138].
