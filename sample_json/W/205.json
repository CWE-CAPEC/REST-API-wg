{"ID":"205","Name":"Observable Behavioral Discrepancy","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product's behaviors indicate important differences that may be observed by unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its internal state or decision process, or (2) differences from other products with equivalent functionality.","ExtendedDescription":"Ideally, a product should provide as little information about its internal operations as possible. Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"203","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"514","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Access Control"],"Impact":["Read Application Data","Bypass Protection Mechanism"]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2002-0208","Description":"Product modifies TCP/IP stack and ICMP error messages in unusual ways that show the product is in use.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0208"},{"Reference":"CVE-2004-2252","Description":"Behavioral infoleak by responding to SYN-FIN packets.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2252"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"PLOVER","EntryName":"Behavioral Discrepancy Infoleak"},{"TaxonomyName":"WASC","EntryID":"45","EntryName":"Fingerprinting"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["541","580"],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
