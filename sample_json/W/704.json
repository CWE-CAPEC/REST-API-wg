Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.","Effectiveness":"High"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C
