{"ID":"825","Name":"Expired Pointer Dereference","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.","ExtendedDescription":"When a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service, information exposure, or code execution.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"119","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"119","ViewID":"1305","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"119","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"672","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"125","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"787","ViewID":"1000"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"Dangling pointer"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Memory"],"Note":"If the expired pointer is used in a read operation, an attacker might be able to control data read in by the application."},{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"],"Note":"If the expired pointer references a memory location that is not accessible to the product, or points to a location that is \"malformed\" (such as NULL) or larger than expected by a read or write operation, then a crash may occur."},{"Scope":["Integrity","Confidentiality","Availability"],"Impact":["Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands"],"Note":"If the expired pointer is used in a function call, or points to unexpected data in a write operation, then code execution may be possible."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Choose a language that provides automatic memory management."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed.
