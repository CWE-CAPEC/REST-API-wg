{"ID":"686","Name":"Function Call With Incorrect Argument Type","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies an argument that is the wrong data type, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.","ExtendedDescription":"This weakness is most likely to occur in loosely typed languages, or in strongly typed languages in which the types of variable arguments cannot be enforced at compilation time, or where there is implicit casting.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"628","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Quality Degradation"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Testing"],"Description":"Because this function call often produces incorrect behavior it will usually be detected during testing or normal operation of the product. During testing exercise all possible control paths will typically expose this weakness except in rare cases when the incorrect function call accidentally produces the correct results or if the provided argument type is very similar to the expected argument type."}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"EXP37-C","EntryName":"Call functions with the correct number and type of arguments","MappingFit":"CWE More Specific"},{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"FIO47-C","EntryName":"Use valid format strings","MappingFit":"Imprecise"},{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"POS34-C","EntryName":"Do not call putenv() with a pointer to an automatic variable as the argument"},{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"STR37-C","EntryName":"Arguments to character handling functions must be representable as an unsigned char"},{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP1","EntryName":"Glitch in computation"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
