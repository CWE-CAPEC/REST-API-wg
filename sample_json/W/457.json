They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"High","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"908","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"665","ViewID":"1305","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"665","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Sometimes"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Sometimes"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"Perl","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"PHP","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"In C, using an uninitialized char * in some string libraries will return incorrect results, as the libraries expect the null terminator to always be at the end of a string, even if the string is empty."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability","Integrity","Other"],"Impact":["Other"],"Note":"Initial variables usually contain junk, which can not be trusted for consistency.
