{"ID":"1048","Name":"Invokable Control Element with Large Number of Outward Calls","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The code contains callable control elements that\n         contain an excessively large number of references to other\n         application objects external to the context of the callable,\n         i.e. a Fan-Out value that is excessively large.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nWhile the interpretation of \"excessively large Fan-Out value\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 5 referenced objects.\n\n\nThis issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"710","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Maintainability"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCMM","EntryID":"ASCMM-MNT-4"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
