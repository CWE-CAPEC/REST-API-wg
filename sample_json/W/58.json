{"ID":"58","Name":"Path Equivalence: Windows 8.3 Filename","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product contains a protection mechanism that restricts access to a long filename on a Windows operating system, but it does not properly restrict access to the equivalent short \"8.3\" filename.","ExtendedDescription":"On later Windows operating systems, a file can have a \"long name\" and a short name that is compatible with older Windows file systems, with up to 8 characters in the filename and 3 characters for the extension. These \"8.3\" filenames, therefore, act as an alternate name for files with long names, so they are useful pathname equivalence manipulations.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"41","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Windows","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity"],"Impact":["Read Files or Directories","Modify Files or Directories"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["System Configuration"],"Description":"Disable Windows from supporting 8.3 filenames by editing the Windows registry.
