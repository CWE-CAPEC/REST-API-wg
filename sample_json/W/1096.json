{"ID":"1096","Name":"Singleton Class Instance Creation without Proper Locking or Synchronization","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product implements a Singleton design pattern but does not use appropriate locking or other synchronization mechanism to ensure that the singleton class is only instantiated once.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. by making the instantiation process non-thread-safe and introducing deadlock (CWE-833) or livelock conditions. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"820","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1305","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Reliability"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCRM","EntryID":"ASCRM-RLB-12"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
