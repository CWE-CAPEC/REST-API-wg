{"ID":"130","Name":"Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.","ExtendedDescription":"If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"240","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"119","ViewID":"1305","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"119","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"805","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Sometimes"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Sometimes"},{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"length manipulation"},{"Term":"length tampering"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity"],"Impact":["Read Memory","Modify Memory","Varies by Context"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"When processing structured incoming data containing a size field followed by raw data, ensure that you identify and resolve any inconsistencies between the size field and the actual size of the data."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Do not let the user control the size of the buffer."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Validate that the length of the user-supplied data is consistent with the buffer size."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"ID":"DX-91","Entries":[{"IntroText":"In the following C/C++ example the method processMessageFromSocket() will get a message from a socket, placed into a buffer, and will parse the contents of the buffer into a structure that contains the message length and the message body.
