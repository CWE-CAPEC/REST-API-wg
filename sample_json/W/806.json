Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code. \n\n\n Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \"rebasing\" (for Windows) and \"prelinking\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking. \n\n\n For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335]. \n","Effectiveness":"Defense in Depth","EffectivenessNotes":"These techniques do not provide a complete solution.
