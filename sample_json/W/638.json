By directly requesting the library file (CWE-425), an attacker can bypass this access check."}]},{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"When a developer begins to implement input validation for a web application, often the validation is performed in each area of the code that uses externally-controlled input. In complex applications with many inputs, the developer often misses a parameter here or a cookie there. One frequently-applied solution is to centralize all input validation, store these validated inputs in a separate data structure, and require that all access of those inputs must be through that data structure. An alternate approach would be to use an external input validation framework such as Struts, which performs the validation before the inputs are ever processed by the code."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2007-0408","Description":"Server does not properly validate client certificates when reusing cached connections.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0408"}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP20","EntryName":"Race Condition Window"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["104"],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed-with-Review","Rationale":"This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate","Comments":"Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit","Reasons":["Abstraction"]},"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-196","Authors":["Jerome H.
