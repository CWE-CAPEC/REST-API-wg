{"ID":"1094","Name":"Excessive Index Range Scan for a Data Resource","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product contains an index range scan for a large data table,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut the scan can cover a large number of rows.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n\n\nWhile the interpretation of \"large data table\" and \"excessive index range\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a threshold of 1000000 table rows and a threshold of 10 for the index range.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"405","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Performance"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCPEM","EntryID":"ASCPEM-PRF-7"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
