{"ID":"662","Name":"Improper Synchronization","Abstraction":"Class","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nSynchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that allow two or more independently-operating processes or threads to ensure that they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with each other. Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"664","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"691","ViewID":"1000"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"362","ViewID":"1000"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Confidentiality","Other"],"Impact":["Modify Application Data","Read Application Data","Alter Execution Logic"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Use industry standard APIs to synchronize your code."}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"SIG00-C","EntryName":"Mask signals handled by noninterruptible signal handlers"},{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"SIG31-C","EntryName":"Do not access shared objects in signal handlers","MappingFit":"CWE More Abstract"},{"TaxonomyName":"CLASP","EntryName":"State synchronization error"},{"TaxonomyName":"The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)","EntryID":"VNA03-J","EntryName":"Do not assume that a group of calls to independently atomic methods is atomic"},{"TaxonomyName":"Software Fault Patterns","EntryID":"SFP19","EntryName":"Missing Lock"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["25","26","27","29"],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed-with-Review","Rationale":"This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate","Comments":"Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit","Reasons":["Abstraction"]},"Notes":[{"Type":"Maintenance","Note":"Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms.
