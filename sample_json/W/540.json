{"ID":"540","Name":"Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"Source code on a web server or repository often contains sensitive information and should generally not be accessible to users.","ExtendedDescription":"There are situations where it is critical to remove source code from an area or server. For example, obtaining Perl source code on a system allows an attacker to understand the logic of the script and extract extremely useful information such as code bugs or logins and passwords.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"538","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Application Data"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design","System Configuration"],"Description":"Recommendations include removing this script from the web server and moving it to a location not accessible from the Internet."}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.","Reasons":["Acceptable-Use"]},"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"Anonymous Tool Vendor (under NDA)","SubmissionDate":"2006-07-19"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"Eric Dalci","ModificationOrganization":"Cigital","ModificationDate":"2008-07-01","ModificationComment":"updated Time_of_Introduction"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-09-08","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2008-10-14","ModificationComment":"updated Description"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2009-03-10","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2011-03-29","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Name"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2011-06-01","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2012-05-11","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2012-10-30","ModificationComment":"updated Potential_Mitigations"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2014-07-30","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-11-08","ModificationComment":"updated Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated Description, Name, Relationships, Type"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2021-10-28","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Information Leak Through Source Code","Date":"2011-03-29"},{"Type":"Rename","PreviousEntryName":"Information Exposure Through Source Code","Date":"2020-02-24"}]}
