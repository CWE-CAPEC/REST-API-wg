{"ID":"577","Name":"EJB Bad Practices: Use of Sockets","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using sockets.","ExtendedDescription":"The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container. In this case, the product violates the following EJB guideline: \"An enterprise bean must not attempt to listen on a socket, accept connections on a socket, or use a socket for multicast.\" The specification justifies this requirement in the following way: \"The EJB architecture allows an enterprise bean instance to be a network socket client, but it does not allow it to be a network server. Allowing the instance to become a network server would conflict with the basic function of the enterprise bean-- to serve the EJB clients.\"","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"573","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Quality Degradation"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design","Implementation"],"Description":"Do not use Sockets when writing EJBs."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"The following Java example is a simple stateless Enterprise JavaBean that retrieves stock symbols and stock values.
