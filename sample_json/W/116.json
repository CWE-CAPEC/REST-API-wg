As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n","LikelihoodOfExploit":"High","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"707","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"74","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Database Server","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Technology","Name":"Web Server","Prevalence":"Often"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"Output Sanitization"},{"Term":"Output Validation"},{"Term":"Output Encoding"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity"],"Impact":["Modify Application Data"],"Note":"The communications between components can be modified in unexpected ways.

For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n"},{"Type":"Terminology","Note":"The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency."},{"Type":"Theoretical","Note":"This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere."},{"Type":"Research Gap","Note":"While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques."}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Community","SubmissionDate":"2006-07-19"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"Sean
