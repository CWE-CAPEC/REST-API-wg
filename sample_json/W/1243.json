{"ID":"1243","Name":"Sensitive Non-Volatile Information Not Protected During Debug","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"Access to security-sensitive information stored in fuses is not limited during debug.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nSeveral security-sensitive values are programmed into fuses to be used during early-boot flows or later at runtime. Examples of these security-sensitive values include root keys, encryption keys, manufacturing-specific information, chip-manufacturer-specific information, and original-equipment-manufacturer (OEM) data. After the chip is powered on, these values are sensed from fuses and stored in temporary locations such as registers and local memories. These locations are typically access-control protected from untrusted agents capable of accessing them. Even to trusted agents, only read-access is provided. However, these locations are not blocked during debug operations, allowing a user to access this sensitive information.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1263","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Access Control"],"Impact":["Modify Memory","Bypass Protection Mechanism"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design","Implementation"],"Description":"\n\nDisable access to security-sensitive information stored in fuses directly and also reflected from temporary storage locations when in debug mode.\n"}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"Sensitive manufacturing data (such as die information) are stored in fuses.
