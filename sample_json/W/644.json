It is important to carefully control data that is being placed both in HTTP response header and in the HTTP response body to ensure that no scripting syntax is present, taking various encodings into account.\n","LikelihoodOfExploit":"High","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"116","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Web Based","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Confidentiality","Availability"],"Impact":["Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands"],"Note":"Run arbitrary code."},{"Scope":["Confidentiality"],"Impact":["Read Application Data"],"Note":"Attackers may be able to obtain sensitive information."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Perform output validation in order to filter/escape/encode unsafe data that is being passed from the server in an HTTP response header."},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Disable script execution functionality in the clients' browser."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"In the following Java example, user-controlled data is added to the HTTP headers and returned to the client.
