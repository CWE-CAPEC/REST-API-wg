{"ID":"1125","Name":"Excessive Attack Surface","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product has an attack surface whose quantitative\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasurement exceeds a desirable maximum.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nOriginating from software security, an \"attack surface\" measure typically reflects the number of input points and output points that can be utilized by an untrusted party, i.e. a potential attacker. A larger attack surface provides more places to attack, and more opportunities for developers to introduce weaknesses. In some cases, this measure may reflect other aspects of quality besides security; e.g., a product with many inputs and outputs may require a large number of tests in order to improve code coverage.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1120","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.","Reasons":["Acceptable-Use"]},"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-966","Authors":["Pratyusa Manadhata"],"Title":"An Attack Surface Metric","PublicationYear":"2008","PublicationMonth":"11","URL":"http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2008/CMU-CS-08-152.pdf"},{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-967","Authors":["Pratyusa Manadhata","Jeannette M.
