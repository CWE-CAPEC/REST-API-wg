{"ID":"821","Name":"Incorrect Synchronization","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner, but it does not correctly synchronize access to the resource.","ExtendedDescription":"If access to a shared resource is not correctly synchronized, then the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1305","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"662","ViewID":"1340","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Confidentiality","Other"],"Impact":["Modify Application Data","Read Application Data","Alter Execution Logic"]}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
