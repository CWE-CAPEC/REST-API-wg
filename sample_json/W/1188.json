{"ID":"1188","Name":"Insecure Default Initialization of Resource","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nDevelopers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"665","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"665","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"RelatedAttackPatterns":["665"],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
