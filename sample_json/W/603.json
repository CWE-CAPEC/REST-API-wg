The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were \"insecure by design\" [REF-1283].

Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications."},{"BodyText":"Multiple vendors used client-side authentication in their OT products."}]}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2022-33139","Description":"SCADA system only uses client-side authentication, allowing adversaries to impersonate other users.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-33139"},{"Reference":"CVE-2006-0230","Description":"Client-side check for a password allows access to a server using crafted XML requests from a modified client.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-0230"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
