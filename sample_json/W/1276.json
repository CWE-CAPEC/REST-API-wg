{"ID":"1276","Name":"Hardware Child Block Incorrectly Connected to Parent System","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"Signals between a hardware IP and the parent system design are incorrectly connected causing security risks.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nIndividual hardware IP must communicate with the parent system in order for the product to function correctly and as intended. If implemented incorrectly, while not causing any apparent functional issues, may cause security issues. For example, if the IP should only be reset by a system-wide hard reset, but instead the reset input is connected to a software-triggered debug mode reset (which is also asserted during a hard reset), integrity of data inside the IP can be violated.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"284","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Not OS-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Architecture","Class":"Not Architecture-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Not Technology-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"This weakness is introduced when integrating IP into a parent design."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability"],"Impact":["Varies by Context"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Testing"],"Description":"System-level verification may be used to ensure that components are correctly connected and that design security requirements are not violated due to interactions between various IP blocks."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"Many SoCs use hardware to partition system resources between trusted and un-trusted entities. One example of this concept is the Arm TrustZone, in which the processor and all security-aware IP attempt to isolate resources based on the status of a privilege bit.
