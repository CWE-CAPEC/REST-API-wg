For example, discrepancies can arise in how to handle duplicate headers like two Transfer-encoding (TE) or two Content-length (CL), or the malicious HTTP message will have different headers for TE and CL.\n\n\nThe inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages can allow the adversary to \"smuggle\" a message to the client/server without the intermediary being aware of it.\n\n\nThis weakness is usually the result of the usage of outdated or incompatible HTTP protocol versions in the HTTP agents.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"436","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"436","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Technology","Class":"Web Based","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"AlternateTerms":[{"Term":"HTTP Request Smuggling"},{"Term":"HTTP Response Smuggling"},{"Term":"HTTP Smuggling"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Non-Repudiation","Access Control"],"Impact":["Unexpected State","Hide Activities","Bypass Protection Mechanism"],"Note":"An attacker could create HTTP messages to exploit a number of weaknesses including 1) the message can trick the web server to associate a URL with another URL's webpage and caching the contents of the webpage (web cache poisoning attack), 2) the message can be structured to bypass the firewall protection mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to a web application, and 3) the message can invoke a script or a page that returns client credentials (similar to a Cross Site Scripting attack)."}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Use a web server that employs a strict HTTP parsing procedure, such as Apache [REF-433]."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Use only SSL communication."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"Terminate the client session after each request."},{"Phase":["System Configuration"],"Description":"Turn all pages to non-cacheable."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"In the following example, a malformed HTTP request is sent to a website that includes a proxy server and a web server with the intent of poisoning the cache to associate one webpage with another malicious webpage."},{"Nature":"Attack","ExampleCode":"POST http://www.website.com/foobar.html HTTP/1.1\n Host: www.website.com\n Connection: Keep-Alive\n Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n Content-Length: 0\n Content-Length: 54\n\n GET /poison.html HTTP/1.1\n Host: www.website.com\n Bla: GET http://www.website.com/page_to_poison.html HTTP/1.1\n Host: www.website.com\n Connection: Keep-Alive"},{"BodyText":"When this request is sent to the proxy server, the proxy server parses the first four lines of the POST request and encounters the two \"Content-Length\" headers.
