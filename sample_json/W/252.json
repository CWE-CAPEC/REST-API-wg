If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Low","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"754","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"754","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"476","ViewID":"1000"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"BackgroundDetails":["Many functions will return some value about the success of their actions.
