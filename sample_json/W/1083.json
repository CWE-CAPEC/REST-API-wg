{"ID":"1083","Name":"Data Access from Outside Expected Data Manager Component","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product is intended to manage data access through a particular data manager component such as a relational or non-SQL database, but it contains code that performs data access operations without using that component.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nWhen the product has a data access component, the design may be intended to handle all data access operations through that component. If a data access operation is performed outside of that component, then this may indicate a violation of the intended design.\n\n\nThis issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1061","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Reliability"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCRM","EntryID":"ASCRM-RLB-10"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
