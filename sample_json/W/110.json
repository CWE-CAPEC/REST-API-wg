One indication that validation logic is not being properly maintained is inconsistencies between the action form and the validation form.\n\n\nAlthough J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1164","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"20","ViewID":"700","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"},{"Phase":"Operation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Other"],"Note":"It is critically important that validation logic be maintained and kept in sync with the rest of the application.
