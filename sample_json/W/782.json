{"ID":"782","Name":"Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control","Abstraction":"Variant","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product implements an IOCTL with functionality that should be restricted, but it does not properly enforce access control for the IOCTL.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nWhen an IOCTL contains privileged functionality and is exposed unnecessarily, attackers may be able to access this functionality by invoking the IOCTL. Even if the functionality is benign, if the programmer has assumed that the IOCTL would only be accessed by a trusted process, there may be little or no validation of the incoming data, exposing weaknesses that would never be reachable if the attacker cannot call the IOCTL directly.\n\n\nThe implementations of IOCTLs will differ between operating system types and versions, so the methods of attack and prevention may vary widely.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"749","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"CanPrecede","CweID":"781","ViewID":"1000"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Unix","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Operating_System","Class":"Windows","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Integrity","Availability","Confidentiality"],"Note":"Attackers can invoke any functionality that the IOCTL offers.
