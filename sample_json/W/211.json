{"ID":"211","Name":"Externally-Generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product performs an operation that triggers an external diagnostic or error message that is not directly generated or controlled by the product, such as an error generated by the programming language interpreter that a software application uses. The error can contain sensitive system information.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"209","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Resultant"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"PHP","Prevalence":"Often"},{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design","Note":"PHP applications are often targeted for having this issue when the PHP interpreter generates the error outside of the application's control.

Create default error pages if necessary."},{"Phase":["Implementation"],"Description":"The best way to prevent this weakness during implementation is to avoid any bugs that could trigger the external error message. This typically happens when the program encounters fatal errors, such as a divide-by-zero. You will not always be able to control the use of error pages, and you might not be using a language that handles exceptions."}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2004-1581","Description":"chain: product does not protect against direct request of an include file, leading to resultant path disclosure when the include file does not successfully execute.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1581"},{"Reference":"CVE-2004-1579","Description":"Single \"'\" inserted into SQL query leads to invalid SQL query execution, triggering full path disclosure.
