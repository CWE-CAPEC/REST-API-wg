{"ID":"834","Name":"Excessive Iteration","Abstraction":"Class","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"The product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.","ExtendedDescription":"If the iteration can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory. In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"691","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Availability"],"Impact":["DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)","DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory)","DoS: Amplification","DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart"],"Note":"Excessive looping will cause unexpected consumption of resources, such as CPU cycles or memory. The product's operation may slow down, or cause a long time to respond. If limited resources such as memory are consumed for each iteration, the loop may eventually cause a crash or program exit due to exhaustion of resources, such as an out-of-memory error."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"Method":"Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tFuzz Tester\n\t\tFramework-based Fuzzer\n\t\tForced Path Execution","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Manual Static Analysis - Source Code","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tCost effective for partial coverage:\n```\n\n\t\tFocused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source\n\t\tManual Source Code Review (not inspections)","Effectiveness":"SOAR Partial"},{"Method":"Automated Static Analysis - Source Code","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tHighly cost effective:\n```\n\n\t\tContext-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer","Effectiveness":"High"},{"Method":"Architecture or Design Review","Description":"\n\nAccording to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:\n\n```\n\t\tHighly cost effective:\n```\n\n\t\tInspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)","Effectiveness":"High"}],"ObservedExamples":[{"Reference":"CVE-2011-1027","Description":"Chain: off-by-one error leads to infinite loop using invalid hex-encoded characters.","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1027"},{"Reference":"CVE-2006-6499","Description":"Chain: web browser crashes due to infinite loop - \"bad looping logic [that relies on] floating point math [CWE-1339] to exit the loop [CWE-835]\"","Link":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-6499"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed-with-Review","Rationale":"This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate","Comments":"Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit","Reasons":["Abstraction"]},"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-62","Section":"Chapter 7, \"Looping Constructs\", Page 327","Authors":["Mark Dowd","John McDonald","Justin Schuh"],"Title":"The Art of Software Security Assessment","Edition":"1st Edition","PublicationYear":"2006","Publisher":"Addison Wesley"}],"ContentHistory":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"CWE Content Team","SubmissionOrganization":"MITRE","SubmissionDate":"2011-03-22"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2011-06-01","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences, Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2012-05-11","ModificationComment":"updated References, Relationships, Taxonomy_Mappings"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2014-07-30","ModificationComment":"updated Detection_Factors"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2017-11-08","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2019-06-20","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships, Type"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-02-24","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2020-12-10","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2021-07-20","ModificationComment":"updated Observed_Examples, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-01-31","ModificationComment":"updated Common_Consequences, Description, Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-04-27","ModificationComment":"updated Relationships"},{"Type":"Modification","ModificationName":"CWE Content Team","ModificationOrganization":"MITRE","ModificationDate":"2023-06-29","ModificationComment":"updated Mapping_Notes"}]}
