{"ID":"1086","Name":"Class with Excessive Number of Child Classes","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Incomplete","Description":"A class contains an unnecessarily large number of\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nThis issue makes it more difficult to understand and maintain the software, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n\nWhile the interpretation of \"large number of children\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 10 child classes.\n","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"1093","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"WeaknessOrdinalities":[{"Ordinality":"Indirect"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Reduce Maintainability"]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"OMG ASCMM","EntryID":"ASCMM-MNT-18"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
