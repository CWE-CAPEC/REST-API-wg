However, duplicate key entries could be inserted by mistake. Because of this ambiguity, duplicate key entries in an association list are not recommended and should not be allowed.","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Low","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"694","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Name":"C","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C++","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"Java","Prevalence":"Undetermined"},{"Type":"Language","Name":"C#","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Implementation"}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Other"],"Impact":["Quality Degradation","Varies by Context"]}],"PotentialMitigations":[{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Use a hash table instead of an alist."},{"Phase":["Architecture and Design"],"Description":"Use an alist which checks the uniqueness of hash keys with each entry before inserting the entry."}],"DemonstrativeExamples":[{"Entries":[{"IntroText":"The following code adds data to a list and then attempts to sort the data."},{"Nature":"Bad","Language":"Python","ExampleCode":"```\n\talist = []\n\twhile (foo()): #now assume there is a string data with a key basename\n\t\tqueue.append(basename,data)\n\t\tqueue.sort()\n```"},{"BodyText":"Since basename is not necessarily unique, this may not sort how one would like it to be."}]}],"TaxonomyMappings":[{"TaxonomyName":"CLASP","EntryName":"Duplicate key in associative list (alist)"},{"TaxonomyName":"CERT C Secure Coding","EntryID":"ENV02-C","EntryName":"Beware of multiple environment variables with the same effective name"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Allowed","Rationale":"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.","Comments":"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
