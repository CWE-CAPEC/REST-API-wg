{"ID":"338","Name":"Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)","Abstraction":"Base","Structure":"Simple","Status":"Draft","Description":"The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.","ExtendedDescription":"\n\nWhen a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.\n\n\nOften a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.\n","LikelihoodOfExploit":"Medium","RelatedWeaknesses":[{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"330","ViewID":"1000","Ordinal":"Primary"},{"Nature":"ChildOf","CweID":"330","ViewID":"1003","Ordinal":"Primary"}],"ApplicablePlatforms":[{"Type":"Language","Class":"Not Language-Specific","Prevalence":"Undetermined"}],"ModesOfIntroduction":[{"Phase":"Architecture and Design"},{"Phase":"Implementation","Note":"REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic."}],"CommonConsequences":[{"Scope":["Access Control"],"Impact":["Bypass Protection Mechanism"],"Note":"If a PRNG is used for authentication and authorization, such as a session ID or a seed for generating a cryptographic key, then an attacker may be able to easily guess the ID or cryptographic key and gain access to restricted functionality."}],"DetectionMethods":[{"DetectionMethodID":"DM-14","Method":"Automated Static Analysis","Description":"Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
