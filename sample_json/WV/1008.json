The weaknesses that are members of each category contain information about how each is introduced relative to the software's architecture. Three different modes of introduction are used: Omission - caused by missing a security tactic when it is necessary. Commission - refers to incorrect choice of tactics which could result in undesirable consequences. Realization - appropriate security tactics are adopted but are incorrectly implemented."}],"Content_History":[{"Type":"Submission","SubmissionName":"Joanna C.S.
