In addition, developers can use a CWE coverage graph to determine which weaknesses are not directly addressed by the standard, which will help identify and resolve remaining gaps in training, tool acquisition, or other approaches for reducing weaknesses."},{"Type":"Product Customers","Description":"If a software developer claims to be following the SEI CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java, then customers can search for the weaknesses in this view in order to formulate independent evidence of that claim."},{"Type":"Educators","Description":"Educators can use this view in multiple ways. For example, if there is a focus on teaching weaknesses, the educator could link them to the relevant Secure Coding Standard."}],"Members":[{"CWE_ID":"1134","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1135","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1136","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1137","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1138","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1139","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1140","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1141","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1142","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1143","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1144","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1145","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1146","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1147","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1148","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1149","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1150","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1151","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1152","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1153","View_ID":"1133"},{"CWE_ID":"1175","View_ID":"1133"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-970","Authors":["The Software Engineering Institute"],"Title":"SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java","URL":"https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEI+CERT+Oracle+Coding+Standard+for+Java"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a View.
