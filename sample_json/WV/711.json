As a result, this mapping is not complete with respect to all of CWE. In addition, some concepts were mentioned in multiple Top Ten items, which caused them to be mapped to multiple CWE categories. For example, SQL injection is mentioned in both A1 (CWE-722) and A6 (CWE-727) categories."},{"Type":"Relationship","Note":"As of 2008, some parts of CWE were not fully clarified out in terms of weaknesses.
