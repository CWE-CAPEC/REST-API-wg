{"ID":"1003","Name":"Weaknesses for Simplified Mapping of Published Vulnerabilities","Type":"Graph","Status":"Incomplete","Objective":"CWE entries in this view (graph) may be used to categorize potential weaknesses within sources that handle public, third-party vulnerability information, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). By design, this view is incomplete; it is limited to a small number of the most commonly-seen weaknesses, so that it is easier for humans to use. This view uses a shallow hierarchy of two levels in order to simplify the complex, category-oriented navigation of the entire CWE corpus.","Members":[{"CWE_ID":"20","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"74","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"116","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"119","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"200","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"269","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"287","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"311","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"326","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"327","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"330","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"345","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"362","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"400","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"404","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"407","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"436","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"610","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"662","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"665","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"668","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"669","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"670","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"672","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"674","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"682","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"697","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"704","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"706","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"732","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"754","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"755","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"834","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"862","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"863","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"913","View_ID":"1003"},{"CWE_ID":"922","View_ID":"1003"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-1","Authors":["NIST"],"Title":"CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration","URL":"http://nvd.nist.gov/cwe.cfm"}],"MappingNotes":{"Usage":"Prohibited","Rationale":"This entry is a View.
