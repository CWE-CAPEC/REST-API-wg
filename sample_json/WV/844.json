{"ID":"844","Name":"Weaknesses Addressed by The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011)","Type":"Graph","Status":"Obsolete","Objective":"CWE entries in this view (graph) are fully or partially eliminated by following the guidance presented in the book \"The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java\" published in 2011. This view is considered obsolete as a newer version of the coding standard is available.","Audience":[{"Type":"Software Developers","Description":"By following The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java, developers will be able to fully or partially prevent the weaknesses that are identified in this view. In addition, developers can use a CWE coverage graph to determine which weaknesses are not directly addressed by the standard, which will help identify and resolve remaining gaps in training, tool acquisition, or other approaches for reducing weaknesses."},{"Type":"Product Customers","Description":"If a software developer claims to be following The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java, then customers can search for the weaknesses in this view in order to formulate independent evidence of that claim."},{"Type":"Educators","Description":"Educators can use this view in multiple ways. For example, if there is a focus on teaching weaknesses, the educator could link them to the relevant Secure Coding Standard."}],"Members":[{"CWE_ID":"845","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"846","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"847","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"848","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"849","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"850","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"851","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"852","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"853","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"854","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"855","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"856","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"857","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"858","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"859","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"860","View_ID":"844"},{"CWE_ID":"861","View_ID":"844"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-813","Authors":["Fred Long","Dhruv Mohindra","Robert C.
