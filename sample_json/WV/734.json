{"ID":"734","Name":"Weaknesses Addressed by the CERT C Secure Coding Standard (2008)","Type":"Graph","Status":"Obsolete","Objective":"CWE entries in this view (graph) are fully or partially eliminated by following the guidance presented in the book \"The CERT C Secure Coding Standard\" published in 2008. This view is considered obsolete, as a newer version of the coding standard is available. This view statically represents the coding rules as they were in 2008.","Audience":[{"Type":"Software Developers","Description":"By following the CERT C Secure Coding Standard, developers will be able to fully or partially prevent the weaknesses that are identified in this view. In addition, developers can use a CWE coverage graph to determine which weaknesses are not directly addressed by the standard, which will help identify and resolve remaining gaps in training, tool acquisition, or other approaches for reducing weaknesses."},{"Type":"Product Customers","Description":"If a software developer claims to be following the CERT C Secure Coding standard, then customers can search for the weaknesses in this view in order to formulate independent evidence of that claim."},{"Type":"Educators","Description":"Educators can use this view in multiple ways. For example, if there is a focus on teaching weaknesses, the educator could link them to the relevant Secure Coding Standard."}],"Members":[{"CWE_ID":"735","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"736","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"737","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"738","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"739","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"740","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"741","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"742","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"743","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"744","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"745","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"746","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"747","View_ID":"734"},{"CWE_ID":"748","View_ID":"734"}],"References":[{"ExternalReferenceID":"REF-597","Authors":["Robert C.
